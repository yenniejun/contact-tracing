', ""And joining us now from the campaign trail in Alabama, former Vice President Joe Biden. \xa0Mr. Vice President, congratulations on your victory in South Carolina last night. What do you think it does for your campaign? \xa0BIDEN: Well, I think it's a big boost. I think it starts the -- a real comeback and I think it -- we picked up a lot of delegates practically speaking, and we now have amassed more popular vote than anyone running for the nomination but we have a long, long way to go. This is a marathon. \xa0WALLACE: Well, let me ask you about that because now you face Super Tuesday in just 48 hours where 44 percent of the delegates will be allocated. And, frankly, you're at a big disadvantage going into there. "", 'Let me count the ways. ', ""You haven't held a rally in a Super Tuesday state in more than a month. In California, Bernie Sanders has 23 offices and more a hundred staffers. You have one office and your campaign won't say how many staffers. And while Sanders is spending $13.5 million on TV ads for Tuesday you started running your first ad this week. "", ""Question, if you get clobbered on Super Tuesday, what does that do to your campaign? \xa0BIDEN: Well, it certainly doesn't help, but there's a lot of big states coming up after that, Florida and Georgia and Pennsylvania and Michigan. I mean, a whole range of states that still are in play. "", ""But I -- look, I'm not pundit, Chris, and I'm not being a wise guy. I'm being -- I'm being deadly earnest. I feel good about where we are and I think ultimately, people are now beginning to focus on the opposition in the way that they focused on the -- in the Democratic Party, the way they've been focused on me for a long time. \xa0And I think that -- I think it's about the message and I think that people know who I am, although I've been outspent 41-to-1, I think it was -- or 40-to-1 in South Carolina and other places. I think we've now began to raise money, nothing like they have raised. "", ""We have raised about $18 million this month, just $5 million overnight, and so, I think things are picking up, but we'll see. \xa0WALLACE: And talking about money, Mayor Bloomberg has bought TV time on two networks tonight to deliver a primetime address -- three-minute primetime address to the nation. "", ""How do you compete with that? \xa0BIDEN: I'm on your show. By doing as much of the free press and earned media as I can. I'm being serious. "", ""And, look, I think that, you know, money can buy a lot but it can't -- it can't hide your record and it can't make you something that you are or are not. And -- so I just think --one of the best things that I think happening is now, Mike is a solid, serious guy. He's in the debates now, and we're able to discuss the differences we have. "", ""But I think the Democratic Party is looking for a Democrat, not a socialist, not a former Republican, a Democrat to -- to be their nominee and to bring the country together in a way that I've been able to do my whole career. \xa0WALLACE: Speaking of Democratic socialist, how damaging do you think Bernie Sanders would be on the top of the ticket, both in terms of trying to beat Donald Trump and also for Democrats down ballot? \xa0BIDEN: Well, look, if he's the nominee, I will support him, but I think it makes it very difficult down ballot. And this is no great secret to anybody, you can't run as an independent socialist, now a Democratic socialist, and do particularly -- expect to do very well in the states we have to win, like North Carolina, like Georgia, like Florida, like Texas, like Pennsylvania, et cetera. \xa0And so I -- look, I believe that if I'm on the top of the ticket, we will win back the Senate and we'll keep the House. I went in last time in 2018 to 24 purple states, we won 41 House seats, we won governor seats. I was invited in, I don't know that they invited the -- Bernie Sanders to come in, not because he's a bad guy, but he comes from a different perspective. "", ""Look, the people aren't looking for revolution, they're looking for results. But he talks about a revolution. Let's get results, and the idea that Bernie's going to be able to come up with $60 trillion in 10 years to do the things he wants, there's no -- there's really no path there. \xa0And I can get that done on health care by building on Obamacare with a Biden Medicare option in it. I can do this in terms of Ebola -- I mean, excuse me, in terms of dealing with the issues that relate to what we put together when we faced the pandemic of Ebola, I've had the experience of doing that. I can do this in terms of bringing together the world with regard to climate change and so on. \xa0So, I -- this is -- these are things that have been in my wheelhouse, things that I've done. And I have a record of real success. \xa0Bernie doesn't have much of a record at all as accomplishments in the United States Senate and United States Congress. He's done a few things. He's worked with John McCain on health care -- excuse me, on veterans' issues, and post office is another thing. \xa0But I've passed big legislation. I'm able to cross the aisle and I've been able to get things done. \xa0WALLACE: Mr. Vice President, if Sanders is such a threat to the Democratic Party and the possibility of Democratic majorities, should all of the centrists get together? \xa0I know you have a pretty clogged lane. There's you, there's Bloomberg, there's Buttigieg, there's Klobuchar. \xa0Should you get together after Super Tuesday and however is in the lead amongst you, whoever has the most delegates, all the other say, we're going to get out and we're going to support this moderate to go one-on-one against Bernie Sanders? \xa0BIDEN: Well, you know, it's kind of interesting, on your show, for me to be called a moderate, Chris. I know it's 13 years since I've been on, but I've never been called a moderate on your show before, and I don't consider myself -- including myself -- \xa0WALLACE: A relative moderate. \xa0(LAUGHTER) \xa0(CROSSTALK) \xa0BIDEN: You know what I mean, and I'm not criticizing you (ph). \xa0I'm making the point that I have a very, very progressive record and the issue is what we -- what can get done. \xa0And, look, it's not for me to tell any other candidate that they should get out of the race. They'll know whether or not they remain viable, whether they have a chance. And I'm confident that the primaries that are coming up and the ones that follow are going to winnow that field. And -- and I think people will do the right thing. But I'm not going to presume to tell anybody to get out (ph). \xa0(CROSSTALK) \xa0WALLACE: Well, let me ask you a question directly then. If Super Tuesday ends and there's another so-called moderate or a centrist who's leading you in delegates, would you consider getting out to give them a clear path against Sanders? \xa0BIDEN: Well, look, I'm not going to -- I'm not going to speculate on any of those kinds of things. I think we're going to do well. I know I am running. I'm not running against any of the Democrats. I'm running against this -- what -- what our present president is doing and what he stands for and I'm going to stay in my message. \xa0And I've started off saying we have to restore the dignity and honor of the office and the soul of this country, to gain respect in the country and around the world. We have to deal with bringing -- reestablishing the middle class and bringing everybody along, including the poor having an opportunity to get up, and as well we have to unite the country. \xa0And I used to be criticized for saying all these -- all those three things when I started. Now we know most Democrats are saying the same thing. \xa0Who can get it done? Who can put his country together? Who can restore the dignity and honor of the country, from my perspective anyway? \xa0WALLACE: Mr. Biden -- \xa0BIDEN: And I think -- and I'm best equipped to do that. \xa0WALLACE: Mr. Vice President, I don't especially like asking you about this, but it is an issue in the campaign and that has been your sometimes shaky performance on the campaign trail. \xa0Here's a story that you told at least three times about Nelson Mandela. Take a look. \xa0(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) \xa0BIDEN: I had the great honor of meeting him. I had a great honor of being arrested with our U.N. ambassador on the streets of Soweto trying to get to see him on Robbens Island. \xa0(END VIDEO CLIP) \xa0WALLACE: You now say you weren't arrested and that it didn't happen in Soweto. You were at the airport in Johannesburg and you were stopped from going through the door for blacks. "", ""I guess the question is, were you confused or were you just trying to embellish a story? \xa0BIDEN: No. No, what I was trying to -- what I was doing was talking about the fact that I was strongly opposed to apartheid. When we landed and -- we were going to Soweto actually. We landed in Johannesburg and the Afrikaners took me off the plane and took me into one direction, wanted me to go through a white-only door, and in fact, I wouldn't move. I said everybody else is going through to another door, I'm going with the -- with the black delegation that I came with. "", ""They said, no, you can't. And I said, I'm staying here, I'm not going to move. And they would not let me move anywhere so I guess I should have said, I was -- I was detained, I was not able to move forward. \xa0So what they finally did was they went out, and they cleared out a baggage claim area, took us all up through the baggage claim area, up through -- cleared out a restaurant. "", ""Look and if anybody wonders whether or not what I said about my desire, my adamancy about apartheid, you've covered it. Go back and look at joebiden.com and take a look at the -- \xa0WALLACE: No, no. \xa0(CROSSTALK) \xa0BIDEN: -- happened in the -- \xa0WALLACE: Your record is clear. \xa0(CROSSTALK) \xa0WALLACE: Let me ask you though -- here's something else you said this week. Take a look. \xa0(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) \xa0BIDEN: I'm a Democratic candidate for the United States Senate. Look me over. If you like what you see, help out. If not, vote for the other guy (ph). Give me a look though, OK? \xa0(END AUDIO CLIP) \xa0WALLACE: You haven't run for the Senate since 2008. What happened there? \xa0BIDEN: Well, the context was I said to everybody -- I said look I'm going to say the same things I've always said, like I used to campaign in Delaware. I'd say, knocking the door, I said, my name is Joe Biden, Democratic candidate for the United States Senate. Look me over, if you like me help me out. If not, vote for the other guy. "", ""That's the -- a sentence I've repeated throughout making the case and I sent -- and I'm here now to ask you all to look me over. It was in the context of how I said I ran because -- the context is also was that you can't -- as was pointed out by my -- Cedric and others on my campaign and how I ran when I ran for the Senate was people will not -- they expect you to ask them. You have to earn their vote. That was the context for that. \xa0WALLACE: All right. Final question in this regard. "", ""President Trump went after you about this at CPAC yesterday. Take a look at what he said. \xa0(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) \xa0TRUMP: Joe's not going to be running the government. He's just going to be sitting in a home someplace.

"", ""KRISTEN SOLTIS ANDERSON, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Look, everybody loves a winner, having this momentum is very valuable for him. It is helping keep his campaign afloat. But with the short time frame, the problem he's going to have is, I still believe the Biden campaign does not have a clear and concise message in the way that someone like Bernie Sanders does.

And when you get a nice bounce out of a state like South Carolina, a pretty big bounce, I mean, it was a good old- fashioned shellacking in South Carolina, that can help in a lot of the states Donna just mentioned.

One is the early vote as Kristen talked about, the other is Mike Bloomberg, Mike Bloomberg got into this race saying he was going to be the last line of defense against Bernie Sanders.

"", ""WALLACE: Let me pick up on that with you, Katie, because there is polling that shows that socialism is not the buzzword that it has traditionally been for some voters, especially younger voters. Do you think it's possible, first in the Democratic primary, then in a general election for Bernie Sanders to make socialism mainstream? "", ""KATIE PAVLICH, TOWNHALL.COM EDITOR: I think he already has. If you look at the way that young people view the word socialism, even though they can't always define exactly what that means, you look at the number of people in these FOX News voter analysis polls that we have been doing, what they actually believe in. They line up with a lot of what Bernie Sanders is pushing with his platform which is socialism. "", ""I would add that Bernie Sanders and his record, especially over the past week, defending the Castro regime, his record personally of honeymooning in the USSR, that was communism, not just Democratic socialism as he likes to say. So, that is something, certainly he's been able to take mainstream in the Democratic Party. Whether he can do that nationally, I'm not sure. "", ""But what he is good at doing is building coalition.

And also, if you look at Nevada and the way that Bernie Sanders came out of that with the coalition, a diverse coalition, and the fact that people are already voting for him in places like California and Colorado, and how he's -- right behind Joe Biden in Texas, this is still something that Joe Biden has to worry about, and whether he can expand the coalition at this point is a real big question. "", 'WALLACE: We should also point out, for all the talk about how Iowa and New Hampshire were untypical states because they were 90 percent white, South Carolina is also an untypical state because the electorate there in that primary last night was over 50 percent African-American. ', ""Final question to you, Kristen, we've got about a minute left. What does polling say about how tough it will be to sell socialism, not communism, but socialism to majority of Americans? "", ""SOLTIS ANDERSON: So, FOX News's owned polling from just this week shows it's only about 3 out of 10 voters say they would be comfortable with someone who is a socialist being president, that only about a third of America is OK with socialism. But socialism is defined very differently for younger voters versus older voters, as Katie was mentioning. "", ""I think, in terms of the word socialism, lots of voters don't like it, but the idea of the government providing very extensive health care benefits, et cetera, a lot of voters are actually much more on board with that. I would not count out the ideological places American voters may be willing to go. "", ""WALLACE: You know, it's also interesting. In our voter analysis, FOX News voter analysis, Bernie Sanders won among people, both black and white under 45, he clobbered among blacks and whites over 45. "", 'Thank you, panel.

More than 86,000 people have contracted the illness, most in mainland China. But 59 nations now have confirmed cases, including the first death here in the U.S. President Trump says there's no need to panic. "", 'Joining us with the latest, Secretary of Health and Human Services, Alex Azar, ', 'Mr. Secretary, welcome to FOX NEWS SUNDAY. ', 'ALEX AZAR, HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES SECRETARY: Good to be with you, Chris, thank you. ', ""WALLACE: What's the latest count of coronavirus cases in the U.S. of unknown origin where, at this point, the only explanation is community spread?\xa0 AZAR: You bet. "", ""So we've got about -- we've had 23 cases here in the United States that are not a result of us repatriating individuals from Japan or China. Of those individuals, we've got cases in Chicago, as well as Washington and Oregon where we do -- and two in California where we do not yet know why they contracted the novel coronavirus.\xa0 So we're deployed with state and local people, and we're working to get to the bottom of it.\xa0 WALLACE: So -- so we knew about the cases on the West Coast. There's now one in Chicago as well?\xa0 AZAR: There -- there is one overnight in Chicago, yes.\xa0 WALLACE: And did the man who died from the illness in Washington State, did he get it, best of your knowledge, from community spread? And what can you tell us about this nursing home in Kirkland, Washington?\xa0 AZAR: So at this point we do not know how this gentleman contracted the illness. And we're -- obviously want to express our sympathies to him and to -- on behalf of him and his family for this fatality. "", ""He is in a -- he was in a hospital. This hospital is one where the nursing home sends patients. There are cases in that nursing home also. So right now there's a large investigation going on in the nursing home, the hospital, contact tracing to try to determine where that disease was introduced and how it might have spread.\xa0 WALLACE: But you don't know. So, at this point, this is a community transmission, which means it's somewhere out in that community, in Kirkland, Washington?\xa0 AZAR: At this point it's a suspected community transmission, yes.\xa0 WALLACE: And that's concerning, right?\xa0 AZAR: Any community transmission is concerning. That's why we've been very clear from the outset, we're going to have more cases here in the United States in spite of the president's aggressive efforts at containment. We'll see more cases. We'll see some forms of community spreading.\xa0 But the risk to any individual American remains low. Thanks to the efforts the president's taken, they stay low. We're working to keep it that way. But things can change rapidly. But they should know, we have the best public health system in the world though looking out for them.\xa0 WALLACE: Let's talk about some of the new measures the president is considering. He announced a travel advisory yesterday to South Korea -- parts of South Korea and Italy. "", 'What would it take to go to a travel ban? And how seriously is he considering shutting down our southern border with Mexico?\xa0 AZAR: Well, right now Mexico has very few cases. So that would -- that would take a real change in the epidemiological profile and the risk to the United States from there. ', ""I think what he was trying to say is, all things are on the table. We're not going to take anything off the table in our armamentarium of tools we have to protect the American people.\xa0 So what he announced yesterday is -- we already had level three travel warnings for all of Italy and all of South Korea. That means essential travel only is recommended. But for the impacted areas in northern Italy and the one region of South Korea, we escalated that from the State Department to a level four advisory, which says do not go to these parts of Italy and to South Korea. \xa0WALLACE: And is there a point at which you could go to a travel ban? \xa0AZAR: We could look at using 212F, which is the procedure we've used for China, where we actually restrict entry from certain countries. The -- the point is with Italy and South Korea we have highly developed public health and health care systems. We have transparent leadership and very aggressive action that's been on it from day one. So, at this point, we think advising people not to go is the right measure, but everything will always be on the table. \xa0WALLACE: What about -- there's talk of invoking war powers to require U.S. companies to manufacture some goods in the national interest. One possibly -- I know you have millions of them, but one is that you might actually require companies to manufacture more protective masks. "", ""AZAR: That's right. So that's called the Defense Production Act. I believe it came into existence during the Korean War. It's actually used fairly commonly for Defense Department procurements here in the United States. Effectively, we can determine that our production should get to the front of the line. And so we go before any other contract so that they might have -- \xa0WALLACE: So -- so where are you on doing that? \xa0AZAR: So right now we are initiating the procurement processes for personal protective equipment, so that would be masks, as well as gowns, gloves, et cetera. We are -- we've got that process initiated. We're gathering information from potential vendors. "", ""WALLACE: But is that going to be under the War Powers Act that you're going to -- \xa0AZAR: If we need to. We'll -- we'll use it if we need to, but we, obviously, if we can work cooperatively with any vendor, we'd rather do that. "", ""But we're waiting for the emergency supplemental funding from Congress because, of course, we need that money to fully fund those procurements. \xa0WALLACE: One concern that -- that some Americans have is that President Trump and some of his advisors are low balling the risk from the coronavirus for political purposes. "", ""Here's one example. \xa0(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) \xa0DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Looks like by April, you know, in theory, when it gets a little warmer, it miraculously goes away. Oh, that's true. "", ""DR. ROBERT REDFIELD, DIRECTOR, CDC: I think this virus is probably with us beyond this season or beyond -- beyond this yet and I think eventually the virus will find a foothold and we will get community based transmission. \xa0(END AUDIO CLIP) \xa0WALLACE: Do you know that the coronavirus is going to disappear in April when the weather gets warmer? \xa0AZAR: No, we don't know that. The normal coronavirus, the annual cold, and -- as well as flu and other respiratory illnesses, often do dissipate and go away in warmer seasons. The virus just doesn't survive well in the warmer climate, warmer atmosphere. But we do not know as to this novel coronavirus how it will interact. SARS, for instance, which was a novel coronavirus, did not dissipate in April. "", ""What the president's been saying is, we hope that it will be like the regular cold or regular flu and dissipate, but we do not know. \xa0WALLACE: But here's another example of what some people are calling low balling by the president. "", ""Take a look. \xa0(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) \xa0TRUMP: Because of all we've done, the risk to the American people remains very low. \xa0DR. NANCY MESSONNIER, CDC: It's not so much a question of if this will happen anymore, but rather more of a question of exactly when this will happen and how many people in this country will have severe illness. \xa0(END AUDIO CLIP) \xa0WALLACE: Well, since Dr. Messonnier spoke, we have begun to see community transmission. We have seen severe illnesses. We have seen at least one death. "", ""Can you understand the concern about mixed messages coming from the administration? \xa0AZAR: I could understand the concern, but I hope people will understand what we're trying to do. We're trying to level with the American people at all times. So Dr. Messonnier was very clear with accurate information. The risk is low. It remains low. But we have always expected we'd see -- we would see more transmission. And as she predicted, we will see at least some limited community transmission. \xa0The president, though, is also trying to keep balance in messaging so that the American people don't engage in unwarranted panic. For instance, people running out and buying face masks. That's not needed. That's indicated. We don't recommend it. It actually can be harmful to individuals in an infection situation. "", ""So he's trying to keep good balance, I'm trying to keep good balance. But we're also trying to be radically transparent with our information to make sure folks know what might be coming so they can mentally prepare, as well as engage in normal prepared effectiveness.\xa0 WALLACE: I want to pick up on that with you because clearly part of public health is psychology. And in the last week we saw the Dow Jones go down 3,500 points. We see people buying masks, hoarding food and other supplies. Obviously part of this is a reasonable response to an unknown threat, but do you see some elements of panic?\xa0 AZAR: I see elements of uncertainty. I was with Secretary Mnuchin yesterday at our task force meeting at the White House and he was talking about the stock market reaction and how so much of the market is just dealing with uncertainty. And we're dealing with a novel virus. And so there is uncertainty. And I know that can make people feel uncomfortable. And that's why we are trying to give the American people all the information we have when we have it so they don't think there's secret information they're not getting. That at least helps -- we say what uncertainties we've got, and as we resolve them, we try to clarify. "", ""WALLACE: You just think (ph) people are overreacting?\xa0 AZAR: Yes, absolutely. If people are going out and buying face masks, that's not necessary. In fact, we need those masks for the people who should be using them, which are health care workers taking care of patients.\xa0 WALLACE: Finally, a whistleblower in your department raised a concern about a number, I think a dozen HHS workers who apparently said -- sent to receive the first evacuees from China, she says without proper gear, without proper training. And she raised this concern. "", ""I know you say you're investigating, but that woman, was she reassigned, as she claims, after she raised this concern?\xa0 AZAR: So, first, we -- it is vitally important that we protect our employees in any situation. It is vitally important that we follow the appropriate isolation or quarantine protocols in dealing with individuals. And it's important that no whistleblower ever be retaliated against. And we will never permit retaliation against the whistleblower.\xa0 Let me give you the facts that we know so far. First, every HHS employee who was involved in the allegations in the whistleblower's complaint has now been well over 14 days from any interaction with individuals and nobody is symptomatic or has the disease, so there was no risk -- there's no risk to the people of HHS, no risk to the community, even if the allegations prove to be true. So that's a very important fact.\xa0 \xa0We also have offered voluntary testing to our employees. It's not medically indicated because they don't have the virus -- "", 'WALLACE: OK. ', ""AZAR: But if it comforts them, we're going to get them tested so they know. "", ""WALLACE: And -- but what happened to the woman? Was she reassigned? You -- the -- she said -- has said more than 10 days ago that she was reassigned. You certainly know whether that happened.\xa0 AZAR: Well, I'm not going to discuss personnel matters. That wouldn't be proper for me to do. But there will be no retaliation against this individual or any other individual.\xa0 We are grateful -- if our employees raise concerns about our processes, if something proves not to be right, we are grateful for that. "", ""WALLACE: So if she was reassigned, I -- you can't -- I know you can't discuss it. If she was reassigned because of raising this complaint, you're saying she'll be restored to the position? "", ""AZAR: Nobody would ever be reassigned or discriminated against or prejudiced or retaliated against because of raising concerns about the functioning of the department.\xa0 WALLACE: And you can't tell me whether that happened. \xa0AZAR: I cannot -- I'm not going to tell you whether that happened because that's still under investigation. We are doing a comprehensive, thorough investigation.\xa0 WALLACE: Secretary Azar, thank you. Thanks for coming in today. And we'll, of course, be tracking your efforts and the efforts of the entire task force to follow and fight this disease in the week ahead.\xa0 AZAR: Thank you, Chris.\xa0 WALLACE: Up next, we ask our Sunday panel about the administration's response so far, and the political and economic fall-out. "", '(COMMERCIAL BREAK) ', '(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ', 'DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Now the Democrats are politicizing the coronavirus. Think of it. And this is their new hoax. ', ""SEN.

And Bernie Sanders returning fire. ', ""And we're back now with the panel. "", ""Katie, how do you think the Trump administration has responded to the coronavirus, and if it continues to tank the markets and hurt the economy, fairly or not, could it hurt the president's chances for re-election? "", ""KATIE PAVLICH, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: It certainly has an impact on the campaign trail, but it's also had Democrats on the campaign trail responds to it that really matters. Can they portray themselves as better leaders on this issue than President Trump, who has been in the Brady briefing room twice in the last four days to talk about this issue. He has President -- or Vice President Mike Pence in charge of a team of people. He has the CDC director, the head of HHS talking about these things on a daily basis, meeting. They're meeting again today. We may hear again from the president. "", ""And, Democrats, too, AP is out with a fact-check today saying that Michael Bloomberg and Joe Biden have been making false statements about the way that the president has handled this in terms of CDC funding. And so Democrats have to be careful here about not trying to stoke panic for political reasons. And the president has a lot to handle in the sense that he has to be able to say, don't panic, go about your lives, but also be prepared for this to get worse before it gets better. "", ""WALLACE: Donna, plenty of Democrats have been attacking the president's response to the virus. So is it wrong for him to respond to then in-kind, as you saw them do at that rally? And what impact do you think, particularly if it continues to hit the economy, which is obviously going to be a Trump selling point, even though he's obviously not responsible for the coronavirus, what impact could that have on the 2020 election? "", 'DONNA BRAZILE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: I think the biggest mistake, and he\'s made a lot of mistakes, is that, you know, by saying the word ""hoax,"" this is a serious public health -- potential public health crisis.

', ""BRAZILE: But here's the thing. And I -- and I take this as serious as anything else. We don't want this to be President Trump's Katrina. I experienced Katrina. No one wants to see their president fail. "", 'At the notion that the president of the United States is out there pointing fingers at Democrats when he should be doing everything to ensure that we have test kits, that we have the public health sector mobilized to help people, that our hospitals have supplies, that is what you want a president to do in crises like this. To put politics in the middle of this, and I understand that the president wants to react every day to every different headline, but he has to mobilize the federal government to make sure that we can handle this emergency. ', ""Right now we're looking at governors who are like basically saying, give us kits, give us kits, we've got to test people. We haven't tested enough people, Chris, and that -- I think that is the number one priority the president should be focused in on. "", 'WALLACE: All right, there is other big news this weekend, and that is that the U.S. and the Taliban signed a peace deal yesterday that provides for a partial drawdown of U.S. troops, the Taliban renouncing al Qaeda, and talks between the Afghan government and the opposition. ', 'Here was Secretary of State Pompeo at the signing ceremony. ', '(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ', ""MIKE POMPEO, SECRETARY OF STATE: The agreement that we will sign today is the true test of this effort. We will closely watch the Taliban's compliance with their commitment and calibrate the pace of our withdrawal to their actions. "", '(END VIDEO CLIP) ', ""WALLACE: Kristen, at this point in what is by far America's longest war, how much of a consensus is there among Americans that we need to get out? "", ""KRISTEN SOLTIS ANDERSON, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: There's very broad consensus. This, over the last decade and a half, has been an issue where Americans went from saying this is the conflict that's worth it, it's good that we are there. "", ""Remember, this was the good war in contrast to Iraq sort of being the bad war during the Obama administration. To the point now where significantly more Americans say that it was not worth it to go to Afghanistan, that we ought to be withdrawing our troops. And so even though there is plenty of criticism I think of this deal, that it perhaps give the Taliban too much, at this point, because Americans are so exhausted with the blood and treasure we have spent there, they may be willing to say, any deal is good, let's bring our boys home. "", 'WALLACE: But, Mo, a lot could go wrong. And -- and even with the best intentions, and even with the -- the feelings of the American people, the Taliban may not keep their promises. That certainly seems quite likely. Al Qaeda or ISIS could reconstitute and become a terror threat to the United States. What happens to Afghan women who have thrived in the absence of the Taliban? ', 'I guess the questions is, is this the smart play politically for 2020, pull our troops out? ', ""MO ELLEITHEE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: I think it's the smart term -- it's the smart short-term political play for this president. This is a president who obsesses over winning the moment, and this is winning this moment, capitalizing on people's very legitimate weariness over a very long war. "", ""But it does have the potential for it to come back, which is why you do see foreign policy -- very serious foreign policy people, conservative and on the left, raising serious concerns about this plan giving too much away to the Taliban, and it might actually force us to come back in, or faces some repercussions down the road that we don't want to deal with. That will be a long-term, bad political and strategic play for the president. But he tends to focus on winning the moment. And in this moment, it's a good play for him. "", ""WALLACE: All right, so if it's Trump versus Sanders, they're both going to say pull them out. But if it were Trump versus Biden, you might have Biden in a situation where he's the one, not that he was for a lot of the things we did in Afghanistan anyway, certainly was against the troop surge under Barack Obama, where Biden is taking the more moderate position. Is that something that you think is going to get much backing from Americans? "", ""ELLEITHEE: I think saying we want to get out, let's do it the right way so that we don't have to go back in later is something a lot of people can respond to. But in sort of today's, you know, Twitter defined communication landscape, it takes a few extra steps. So the president, I think, is leaning on, as I said, something that's going to work very well with his base and with people who are rightfully weary, but it is -- it does have the potential to come back down the road and hurt him if the Taliban do not keep their promises, which a lot of people believe is a very likely scenario. "", ""PAVLICH: But they've -- they've blunted that argument at the beginning, because this is not the administration spiking the football. You have Pompeo and Secretary of Defense Mark Esper saying we are cautiously optimistic about this. We have a number of steps that the Taliban has to meet before we are willing to do our part of this agreement, including coming to the table with every sector of Afghan civil society and hammering out their own internal deals. "", 'So, yes, there is potential, we could have to go back in, but the administration is not saying that this is a roaring success at this moment. They are saying, we have many steps to go before we are capable and able to completely withdraw troops from Afghanistan, which will happen in sections, not all at once. ', 'WALLACE: You -- ', 'ELLEITHEE: The secretary is making that point, I think, fairly effectively. The president is not bringing it the same sort of level of sobriety to that. ', 'PAVLICH: He made that point yesterday when he had his press conference, you know, before speaking about coronavirus. ', ""ELLEITHEE: Well, he's out on the stump at these rallies and he's declaring -- all but declaring victory, right? It just -- it creates a sense, I think, amongst his voters that this is maybe a little bit more certain than I think you very rightfully pointed out it's not. "", 'WALLACE: Donna. ', ""BRAZILE: Well, first of all, I -- the Taliban cannot be trusted. And I think what's going to happen is that they're going to undermine the -- the government. They don't control all of the territory. And so, first of all, we've got to make sure that the Afghanistan government works with the Taliban to ensure that this can go forward before we withdraw, not just our troops, but NATO troops and others who are also invested in this. "", 'WALLACE: But -- we have about 30 seconds left. ', ""Katie, you're quite right, the agreement keeps -- you talk about conditions based. On the other hand, clearly this president has made -- has made it evident he wants to get out. "", ""PAVLICH: And the country has made it evident that he wants to get out. And there are previous presidents, like Barack Obama, who have -- who have promised to do exactly what they're trying to do now. Does that mean that it will happen right away, that there won't be hiccups in -- as the administration has said, spoilers along the way, absolutely not. But the fact that they have agreements now, that the Taliban will distance itself from al Qaeda, and that they will work with the Afghan government to come up with a long-term peace agreement, that's a victory that should be celebrated that has not happened before.

"", 'The now operational weapon, Pentagon officials tell Warrior, is now “fielded.” The new weapon does seem to have emerged quickly, as initial draft plans were underway just within the last year or two. Significantly, Rood’s statement specifically cites that Russia may “believe that employment of low-yield nuclear weapons will give them an advantage over the United States and its allies and partners.”\xa0He adds that U.S. counterattack options ensure a “prompt” response.', 'NAVY MAY ARM NEW DESTROYER WITH CONVENTIONAL MISSILE ABLE TO HIT ANYWHERE ON EARTH IN AN HOUR', 'One tactical advantage to a weapon of this kind, naturally intended to prevent nuclear war, is that it ensures a catastrophic, yet targeted nuclear response option in the event the U.S. is attacked with nuclear weapons.', ""Pentagon officials tell Warrior the low-yield missile warhead and the missile’s re-entry body, involves a modification of the existing Trident II D5 submarine-launched, nuclear-armed ballistic missile.

', 'The weapon has virtually unprecedented range for a conventional weapon and has the ability to hit anywhere in the world in a matter of minutes in some instances. ', 'The concept of the weapon is to enable fast attack against enemy targets from safe standoff distances quickly, potentially at the beginning of a conflict. This would enable rapid attack without having to wait for deployment options or placing vital war assets in closer range of enemy attack. In essence, should a conflict quickly break out, CPS will give command authority a “rapid hit” option to possibly deter further war or destroy crucial enemy targets with “tactical surprise.”', ""NAVY STRATEGY FAST-TRACKS NEW WEAPONS FOR 'OFFENSIVE' ATTACK"", 'Firing this weapon from the new stealth destroyer brings several new strategic and tactical advantages.', 'First and foremost, arming the ship with CPS aligns with the service’s strategic requirements for the ship which, as of 2017, migrated from an initial conception of a largely land-attack destroyer to the “premier strike platform in the surface fleet,” Vice Adm. Rich Brown, Commander, Naval Surfaces Forces, said at the SNA symposium. ', 'As a “blue water” attack platform, the Zumwalt is now being prepared for major power warfare on the “open ocean” and therefore armed with long-range weapons, sensors and other lethality-enhancing technologies.', 'Also, the integration of this long-range strike weapon onto a maritime platform such as the new Zumwalt will capitalize on the ship’s stealthy characteristics, thus allowing for surprise attacks with a lower chance of being detected by enemy sensors.\xa0The ship is built with external contours designed to be less detectable to enemy radar. ', '“The inherent capability of this ship is signatures. (stealth, low radar signatures) It is designed to be stealthy and carry the fight offensively to the adversary,” Smith said.', ""NAVY ACCELERATES NEW SHIP RADAR TO SUPPORT EMERGING 'SEA-ATTACK' STRATEGY"", 'Arming the Zumwalt with this weapon, Smith explained, is at the moment merely something being considered or “looked at” for future possibilities and not yet a program of record.', 'While the program has had various starts and stops in recent years, Congressional decision-makers and Pentagon weapons developers are now giving the weapon a new push toward operational status. A 2019 Congressional Research Service Report, called “Conventional Prompt Global Strike and Long Range Ballistic Missiles,” cited increased budget requests for the program. In particular, the Pentagon’s 2019 budget request increased its desired amount for CPS from $201 million in 2018 to $278 million in 2019, the report says.', 'Part of the program’s ups and downs over the years relate to some stated concerns that, if a conventional weapon travels with the speed, range and trajectory of a nuclear-armed missile, adversaries might be confused as to the precise nature of an attack -- and mistake it for a nuclear attack.', ""NAVY PLANS 'BLUE FORCE' OPEN WATER WEAPONS STRATEGY FOR NEW FRIGATE"", '“CPS could upset stability and possibly increase the risk of a nuclear response to a U.S. attack,” the Congressional report states.', 'CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP', 'Despite this stated concern, developers of the weapon say that it would be distinguishable and not function as a substitute for nuclear weapons but rather a way to “supplement U.S. conventional capabilities,” the CRS report explains.']"

This access can give police and other officials valuable intelligence about criminals, terrorists, and human trafficking networks.

It’s such an invasion of my privacy and I know Big Tech is keeping it all in some database.', 'A: Yes, it’s eerie that Big Data companies know your physical whereabouts, and the breadth of their knowledge is hard to even grasp.

Truman, front - file photo.\n          (U.S. Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Scott Swofford)', 'They are floating attack machines, small cities on the seas and visible examples of U.S. military power -- and the Pentagon now plans to operate 11 of them.', 'Aircraft carriers -- long seen as an indelible image of U.S. strength --\xa0have multi-faceted missions such as maintaining safe passageway through the world’s key waterways, deterring potential enemies by ensuring massive retaliatory strike possibility and, of course, waging war on enemies from the seas.', 'The Trump administration, Pentagon and Navy have now carved a decided path toward a total number of 11 carriers, effectively ending the longstanding debate about how many the U.S. should maintain. Some decision-makers, particularly in the last administration, argued that the Navy could function effectively with only 10 carriers, citing cost and modernization factors. The thinking, as articulated by advocates at the time, was to save money by operating fewer carriers, yet make specific strides to ensure they remain technologically superior. However, Navy leaders and many Pentagon decision-makers have long-cited the fact that the global combatant commander need for carriers has consistently exceeded the number of available carriers. Now, Navy developers say legislation approved for next year has inspired current efforts to “move out” on procurement and preparation for the 11th carrier.', 'NAVY MAY ARM NEW DESTROYER WITH CONVENTIONAL MISSILE ABLE TO HIT ANYWHERE ON EARTH IN AN HOUR', 'Most of the questions centered upon whether the USS Truman, a Nimitz-class carrier, would complete its mid-life refueling process for further service… or retire early.', '""NDAA (2020 Defense Bill) language re-emphasized the need for 11 aircraft carriers and there was money appropriated by Congress in the FY20 budget to begin advanced planning for the Truman\'s refueling. I received that money and have initiated planning efforts and the procurement of long-lead materials,"" Capt. Charles Ehnes, in-service aircraft carrier program manager, told an audience at the Surface Navy Association Annual Symposium in Arlington, Va. on Jan. 16.', 'A key reason for more carriers, it would seem appropriate, is readiness. Should conflict quickly emerge in various global hotspots, or in unanticipated areas, forward-positioned Carrier Air Wing attack makes power projection much faster and more effective. It brings an advantage of strike proximity in the event that land-launch bases are not immediately within striking range. Also, as mobile attack platforms, carriers can maneuver into positions of strategic advantage, should new intelligence information change the equation. Furthermore, by bringing massive attack possibilities to areas of tactical relevance, carriers can provide a kind of ""back up"" attack protection to forward operating assets such as drones and surveillance planes. Should an adversary be aware of U.S. carriers in striking range, they might be less inclined to risk confrontation by attacking U.S. assets, such as U.S. bases or surveillance planes. In effect, carriers are deterrents.', ""NAVY STRATEGY FAST-TRACKS NEW WEAPONS FOR 'OFFENSIVE' ATTACK"", ""Apart from the expected need for warfare preparedness, carriers are essential to maintaining secure and open global waterways. Much of the Navy's mission, as articulated by senior leaders over the years, involves forward-positioning combat power to ensure safe passage for free trade, friendly travel and international business. U.S. carriers can, in this respect, also perform counterterrorism missions and prevent piracy. Given all these variables, many senior Navy leaders have, for quite some time now, been of the view that current global mission demands simply exceed the amount of available carrier capacity."", 'All of this aligns with the Navy’s current push to make carriers more combat-capable. This strategy appears to have a few possible dimensions. While carriers typically operate in Carrier Strike Groups surrounded by cruisers, destroyers and other warships able to provide protection, a fast-changing threat environment is expected to create the need for more dispersed, or disaggregated operations -- requiring carriers themselves to operate with more integrated offensive and defensive weapons systems.', 'CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP', 'The F-35C, naturally, will bring a new array of attack options for the Carrier Air Wing, not to mention an unprecedented measure of aerial Intelligence, Reconnaissance and Surveillance (ISR). Drawing upon new sensor and targeting technology, the aerial attack range will be significantly changed, and stealth technology will enable air attack to operate in higher threat environments, such as areas containing advanced air-defenses.']"

ANTHONY FAUCI, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES: Thank you very much, Mr. President, Deb. I want to just talk very briefly about two or three things. First, the issue of testing and how that has really changed the complexion of the approach that will going to be able to take. ', 'We right know testing was an issue. We had many questions of testing in this room for a number of times. Now that we literally have hundreds and hundreds of thousands of testing out there, there are a few things that we can do with that. ', ""One of the things is that when we make policy about what we're going to be doing with the rest of the country, particularly those areas that are not hotspots, we need to know what the penetrance of infection is there. "", ""So, we need to put a light on those dark spots that we don't know. We have to act policy-wise on data. And we're going to be getting more data, a lot more data. "", 'The other thing is that the areas of the country that are not hotspots -- that are not going through the terrible ordeal that New York and California and Washington State are going through, they still have a window of a significant degree of being able to contain. ', ""In other words, when you test, you find somebody you isolate them you get them out of circulation, and you do the contact tracing. When you have a big outbreak, it's tough to do anything but mitigation. "", ""We have an opportunity now that we have the availability of testing to do that. So, you're going to be hearing more about how we can inform where we're going, particularly because we have the ability to test. "", ""The second thing is they just want to reiterate what Dr. Birx said about New York. It's a very serious situation, they've suffered terribly through no fault of their own. But what we're seeing now is that understandably, people want to get out of New York. They're going to Florida, they're going to Long Island, they're going to different places. "", ""The idea, if you look at the statistics, it's disturbing about one per thousand of these individuals are infected. That's about eight to 10 times more than in other areas. Which means, when they go to another place for their own safety, they've got to be careful, monitor themselves. If they get sick, bring it to the attention of a physician, get tested. "", ""Also, the idea about self-isolating for two weeks will be very important because we don't want that to be another seeding point to the rest of the country wherever they go. And then, thirdly, just one -- just comment about drugs and the testing of drugs. You know you heard yesterday about drugs being out there that physicians on and off-label way can prescribe it to give people hope of something that hasn't been definitively proven to work but that might have some hope. "", ""I don't want anybody to forget that simultaneously, without doing that, we're also doing randomized clinical trials on a number of candidates. You've heard about candidates, but there are others in the pipeline where we'll be able to design the study and over a period of time particularly since we have so many infections, we'll be able to determine definitively, are these safe and are they effective?

', ""We're gaining great progress on this phase three legislation. Negotiations continue, we've had continued reports. I've been up there with Secretary Mnuchin. Secretary Mnuchin continues today with Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, checking in with the president. They're getting closer and closer, they expect to vote as soon as possible. "", 'I just want to walk through a couple of key points. This legislation is urgently needed to bolster the economy, provide cash injections and liquidity and stabilize financial markets. To get us through a difficult period, a difficult and challenging period in the economy facing us right now. But also, to position us for what I think can be an economic rebound later this year. ', ""We started the year very strong, and then we got hit by the coronavirus in ways that probably nobody imagined possible. We're dealing with that as best we can. This package will be the single largest main street assistance program in the history of the United States. The single largest main street assistance program in the history of United States. "", ""Phase two, delivered the sick leave for individuals, hourly workers, families, and so forth. Phase three, a significant package for small businesses. Loan guarantees will be included. We're going to take out expenses and lost revenues. "", ""As the president said, eligibility requires worker retention. We will maintain the people eligible, we'll maintain their payrolls during this crisis period. And on top of that, we will have direct deposit checks of roughly $3,000 for a family of four, and that will bridge to enhanced, plus step unemployment, insurance benefits that will essentially take those up to full wages. This is one, two, three, four. "", ""You know, a strong workforce requires strong business. You can't have a job without a business to work for. And the hope here is that the companies that were operating very well at the beginning of the year, when the economy was in good shape, we will help them and their employees get through this tough period so they will come out the other side, let's say this -- later this spring or summer, and will continue their operations. That's the key point. "", ""Now, don't forget, there's income tax deferrals for individuals and corporations without interest and penalties, there's student loan interest and principal deferrals without any penalties. "", ""And finally, I want to mention the Treasury's Exchange Stabilization Refund, that will be replenished. It's important because that fund opens the door for Federal Reserve firepower to deal a broad-based way throughout the economy, for distressed industries, for small businesses, for financial turbulence. "", ""You've already seen the Fed take action, they intend to take more action. And in order to get this, we have to replenish the Treasury's emergency fund. It's very, very important. Not everybody understands that. "", 'That fund, by the way, will be overseen by an oversight board and an inspector general. It will be completely transparent. ', 'So, the total package here comes to roughly $6 trillion, $2 trillion direct assistance, roughly $4 trillion in Federal Reserve lending power. Again, it will be the largest main street financial package in the history of the United States. Liquidity and cash for families, small business, individuals, unemployed, to keep this thing going. ', ""We're headed for a rough period, but it's only going to be weeks, we think. Weeks, months, not going to be years, that's for sure. And hopefully, pave the way for continued economic recovery after this crisis departs. Thank you, sir. "", ""TRUMP: Thank you, Larry. I've been hearing that voice for so many years, like 30 years or more maybe, and it's a great voice and it's a great man. So, Larry Kudlow, thank you very much. "", 'KUDLOW: Thank you, sir. ', 'TRUMP: I want to say that, that package, and we went over parts of it, but pretty big parts. It really sets us up to, I think even supersede where we were a month ago. I think we can get up there quickly, and I think it allows us to supersede, it allows us to help these great companies that need help like Boeing, which is -- you know, had a problem and then on top of that problem, it had the virus come in. ', ""But we'll be helping Boeing, we'll be helping the airlines, we'll be helping the cruise lines. We'll be doing a lot of things, and the money will all come back to us, and it will come back to us in a very strong form. And before we take some questions, I'd like to ask our great vice- president to say a few words if you wouldn't mind, please. "", 'MIKE PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Thank you, Mr. President.

People are acting on the president's 15 days to slow the spread, and it is making a material difference. Our experts standing beside us told us that if every American, and regardless of whether you're in an area that's impacted by the outbreak of the coronavirus or not if every American would embrace these guidelines, that we could significantly reduce the number of Americans that would contract the coronavirus, and protect the most vulnerable. "", ""And as the president reflected earlier, tens of millions of Americans are doing just that, and we're grateful. "", 'The focus of our task force, of course, is to slow the spread, to promote mitigation and strategies. Beyond that though, the president has us focused on testing and on supplies, and making sure that those that are enduring the symptoms of the coronavirus, and those who are ministering to them, our extraordinary healthcare workers, have the support that they need. ', ""In the category of supplies, you just heard Dr. Birx, indicate that we've made great progress. We have done more tests in the last eight days than were done in the previous eight weeks, and it's because of the public- private partnership that the president forged with commercial labs. "", ""And I would encourage people around the country to remind your family members and friends that if you don't have symptoms, don't get a test. We want to make sure people who are having symptoms, who have a concern, have the ability to be tested and to have those tests processed. "", ""We're continuing to urge all county hospitals, all labs around the country, to report to the CDC all the results of the test, as it'll give these experts around us the ability to continue to advise the president on best practices. "", ""As I mentioned, we all continue to follow this -- the outbreak around the country and the test results. But as several have mentioned, we're particularly focused on New York. The reality is the New York metro area was 60 percent of the new cases in the country. "", 'And specifically as a layperson, I can tell you that the infection rates are roughly one in 1000 in the New York City metropolitan area, where they are 0.2 percent per 1,000 or 0.1 percent per 1,000 in places like Washington State. ', ""It is the reason why today, the White House coronavirus task force is calling on any American, first and foremost, if you're in the New York City metropolitan area or elsewhere, to take the guidelines that we issued and avoid non-essential travel. "", 'But for anyone in the New York metropolitan area who has traveled, our task force is encouraging you to monitor your temperature, be sensitive to symptoms, and we are asking anyone who has traveled out of the New York City metropolitan area to anywhere else in the country to self-isolate for 14 days. ', ""That we have to deal with the New York City metropolitan area as a high- risk area. And for that reason, we're taking these steps and asking for the cooperation of the American people. "", ""Because of the spread in New York City, we will continue to surge resources. The president's described this, FEMA is coordinating with New York State for the arrival of the USS Comfort in just a matter of a few short weeks. "", ""Over the next 24 hours, more than 4,000 additional ventilators will be delivered to New York State as well. New York State has prioritized three alternative medical facilities.

I want the people of New York City and the greater New York City area to know that we're with you. We're going to continue to provide resources to support your state and local officials as they confront the spread of the coronavirus in that great city. "", 'On the subject of supplies, we had team meetings today at FEMA, which is working on identifying the critical personal protective equipment and ventilators. At this point, FEMA informs us today that they are distributing 7.6 million N95 respirator masks, more than 14 million surgical masks. And FEMA has already shipped 73 pallets of personal protective equipment to New York, 36 pallets of personal protective equipment to the state of Washington. ', ""We'll be meeting again tonight. As you know, the president stood FEMA as a national response center up, and they are in the lead for the approach to the coronavirus which is locally executed, state-managed, and federally supported. And we'll continue to surge those resources and make sure that they're available. "", 'One last word, if I may. The president reflected on the response businesses around the country have brought to this moment. It truly is extraordinary. And the president did initiate the Defense Production Act last week. ', 'But as the president has reflected many times, we will use the Defense Production Act if we need it to mandate production of critical supplies. But so far, no one has said no. And in fact, we see industry stepping up. President mentioned Ford Motor Company working with 3M and G.E. Health to expand production of medical supplies. ', ""We heard that McDonald's is now offering curbside delivery to truckers who are unable to use the drive-through to pick up a Big Mac. And I spoke today, and the president spoke last week with Tim Cook of Apple, and at this moment in time, Apple went to their storehouses and is donating 9 million N95 masks to healthcare facilities all across the country, and to the national stockpile. "", ""There is a level of generosity that I know is inspiring to the president, and it's truly inspiring to all of us who are working on the White House coronavirus task force. "", ""The president's made it clear that he hopes in weeks, not months, to be able to open up the country, but let me make one last encouragement to every American. We will get to that day quicker if every American will put into practice the president's coronavirus guidelines for our nation. 15 days to slow the spread.

"", ""In eight days, because we kept hearing about South Korea. They had a very tough time at the beginning if you remember. In eight days we're doing more testing than they've done in eight weeks. That's a tremendous turn and with our testing, it's going exponentially, it's going up, up, up every day. "", ""So we're going to be able to do things with his very highly sophisticated testing and it's also the test itself is considered the best test. So, on top of doing now, more than anybody else, we have a very high-quality test. That makes a big difference. It also makes a big difference even in terms of opening because we're going to see those areas like the hotspots, but New York City definitely is a very hot spot. Steve.

I was talking to the great governor of Texas. They've done a fantastic job out there, but they have very big sections of Texas where -- you know, it's -- that's like numerous states frankly. "", ""But we can have large sections of -- if we want to do it that way, we could have large sections of the country open. I think it's very important that we start moving on that and start thinking about it because our country wants to be open, our people want it to be open, and they want to -- they want -- they're raring to go. "", ""And I think it's one of the reasons that we're going to have a tremendous bounce back. I think it's going to go very quickly. Also, I want to thank while I'm here. I want to thank Larry for the job he's done. Steve Mnuchin for the job he's done. "", ""If you look at Peter Navarro, he's sort of doing different things. He is really -- he's a force in terms of getting masks and getting all of the ventilators and all the things. He's been fantastic, Peter.

"", ""DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK: Good evening, Bret. Today was a lot easier to look at the screen, but in the past two weeks a lot of anxiety. Just a note from experts, if you are years from retiring, you have time for the stock market to rebound, even on these very volatile lower days. So for example, if we look after the last big shock, credit crisis 2007 through 2009, the stock market lost 48 percent in that time, but recovered in six years, six months, and 17 days to be precise. So if you have years left to work, don't worry. Experts say the urge to panic during volatile sessions may be strong, but stay rational. If past is precedent, the market will be higher 10 years from now. "", ""Market crashes are nauseating. We know that especially for young people, people who haven't experienced one, they are frightening. But time usually works in favor of the long-term investor. So experts say keep contributing to your 401(k)s now, don't even sell on a high day like today. If your employer matches your retirement plan contributions, you are lucky. You are buying shares partly with free money. "", ""Now, if you are closer to retirement or if you have already retired, the economic effect of this virus may fall hard on you. For example, if you are living on a fixed income, companies such as Ford, Delta, Nordstrom, Macy's, they are all putting their dividends on hold, which means your investors are not giving you the income that you counted on. "", ""The Senate as we know battling over this relief bill, and it would include a measure that permits affected saviors to take a hardship withdrawal from 401(k)s of up to $100,000. Most times those withdrawals come with the 10 percent penalty that apply to anybody over under the age of 59-and-a-half, and people would still be on the hook for any income taxes on that amount. However, the measure would give three years to pay back the taxes and then replace the money taken out. This has not yet been decided, but even if it's passed, Bret, experts say, those withdrawals should really be your last resort. "", 'Side road to protecting your retirement account or any asset is to look elsewhere. So for example, 30-year fixed-rate mortgage near a record low, 3.5 percent roughly. So borrowers with the amazing credit scores, they can find even better rates. So if you have a mortgage you can refinance it. You can lower those monthly payments and save money in that way. ', 'So bottom line, Bret, experts say leave your 401(k) alone, it will work out. Try to find savings in another way. Back to you. ', 'BAIER: All right, Deirdre, good advice, thank you very much. ', 'When we come back here I will talk live with Wyoming Republican Senator John Barrasso about the very latest on that phase three stimulus bill, where we are at this hour. ', '(COMMERCIAL BREAK) ', ""BAIER: Other news around the world, the U.S. is cutting $1 billion in funding for Afghanistan over the refusal of rival factions to work together on a peace plan with the Taliban. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo met with Afghanistan's president and his chief opponent during a surprise trip Monday. Pompeo left Kabul without being able to secure a power sharing deal there. He said the $1 billion would be cut unless the two men agreed to form a new government. "", ""The International Olympic Committee is postponing the summer games in Tokyo because of the coronavirus pandemic. The panel says the games must be rescheduled to a date no later than summer of next year. It's the first such postponement for the games, which have been canceled in the past because of war. It came as nations and teams urged the IOC to make the decision to protect the health of athletes.

The major contends China was aware of a novel coronavirus strain in mid- December with multiple doctors raising the alarm among the Chinese medical community. It says the Chinese government made multiple serious mistakes in the early stages of the outbreak that heightened the severity and spread of the pandemic.

', ""BARRASSO: This should have been passed on Sunday, and then it should have been passed yesterday. This should be passed tonight. But yet we are in a delaying pattern based on Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer. The American people need a couple of things. This is a rescue package, probably the largest piece of legislation that Congress has ever done. The resources are needed by our health care providers. And I'm a doctor and I have been talking to doctors, I know what they need. And immediate relief is needed by Americans who need the support that they are not getting in terms of their job, 150 million Americans, many not allowed to go to work. "", ""So we put together what was started as a bipartisan piece of legislation to address these needs. These are supposed to be targeted needs, temporary relief and answers for people. But yet Nancy Pelosi showed up here on Sunday with a liberal wish list that has slowed down the entire process. She comes in, and I've seen her on television, several shows today, no sense of urgency and no true understanding of what the American people are worried about as they wait and they watch for Congress to act. "", ""BAIER: Let me ask you about that. I saw you on the Senate floor yesterday, the Senate floor, and as livid as I've seen you, listing extraneous pieces of the House piece of legislation. Speaker Pelosi was asked about that today, about other items in the bill. Here is what she said. "", '(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ', 'REP. NANCY PELOSI, (D-CA) HOUSE SPEAKER: We had the best minds in the country 24/7, all hands on deck, trying to find a path here. And that is what will be the light at the end of the tunnel. What the president is suggesting is that light at the end of the tunnel could be a train coming out of us if people are out and about in a way that spreads the disease further.

Well, except for COVID-19, it's for the future, but it's not changing policy except as it applies here.

FOX has been putting that up. It's a wind-turbines, solar panels, the Green New Deal for airplanes. It's election reform. Its new powers for members of unions. You got one after another after another. And the holdup I hear tonight in terms of the chatter on the Internet, that the hold up today is funding for Planned Parenthood. I have to tell the American people who are listening, the Republicans are ready to act to provide relief in this rescue operation for our health care providers, and they need it. They need the -- "", ""BAIER: Senator, they are negotiating a Senate bill still. They are not on this House bill. They are still negotiating, from what I'm told, and what the president just said at that news conference, that they are very close to a deal. You are sounding a little bit more negative, but is there a possibility of a deal, do you think, tonight? "", ""BARRASSO: Chuck Schumer this morning said we're on the two-yard line. Then why haven't we crossed the goal line? Republicans have been ready to vote. We voted Sunday, Monday. I want to get this finished tonight. The holdup is the Democrats continue to vote no as Nancy Pelosi tells them to vote no. And Chuck Schumer, who Saturday night said we've had all this great bipartisan work, that has ended. The American people need relief, and we want to get it to them tonight. Nancy said, well, if we don't do it today, we can do it tomorrow. The sense of urgency isn't there and felt by here in the way it is felt by the people at home who are watching and waiting for relief. "", ""BAIER: There is an urgency as well, and you're a doctor, you know this, on the front lines dealing with this pandemic. Here is the governor of Michigan talking about that. "", '(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ', 'GOV. GRETCHEN WHITMER, (D-MI): The allotment of personal protection equipment for one of our hospitals was 747, and 95 masks, 204 gown, 4,467 gloves, and 64 face shields.

', 'BARRASSO: There is a desperate need, and every day that is delayed those needs are not being met. Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer right now are wasting time that we as a nation do not have. We need to get this passed now and get rid of all these extraneous things, focus on the virus, focus on the needs of defeating the virus and the needs of the people who, through no fault of their own, are out of work as a result of what has happened in their lives by the government stepping in and saying, stay home.

You know that it's data and what this virus is doing. What's your response to this? "", ""BARRASSO: That's an ambitious guideline. I share the president's goals there. You have to evaluate the situation on the ground rather than the calendar on the wall. The best way to get there is by abiding by the things that they've recommended so far to slow and stop the spread of the disease. That's the best way that we can get to that goal of Easter Sunday.

Anthony Cirillo, director of government affairs at U.S. Acute Care Solutions, and Dr. Devi Nampiaparampil, she is a physician, director of Metropolis Pain Medicine. Doctors, thanks for being here. we really appreciate it. Let's get to some of these viewers' questions. First, here is Albert. "", '(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ', 'UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Hi. We live about 150 yards downwind from a coronavirus open air testing center. Do we run the risk of an airborne infection? ', '(END VIDEO CLIP) ', 'BAIER: Dr. Cirillo, what do you think? ', 'DR. L. ANTHONY CIRILLO, U.S. ACUTE CARE SOLUTIONS: I would say that the risk from that is extremely low. We know that social distancing, staying six feet apart is already good safe distance, 150 yards would be a pretty safe distance to be from anyone who even we know had the virus. So I would say they are still pretty safe. ', 'BAIER: OK. This is Patricia. She writes in, ""Is it true that the loss of taste and smell are early signs, and if you are still reporting to your job, should you quarantine if you have that?"" Dr. Devi, is that something that we\'ve seen? ', ""DR. DEVI NAMPIAPARAMPIL, METROPOLIS PAIN MEDICINE: The World Health Organization is looking at that right now. That's not one of the classic symptoms that we've been looking for, which is cough, fever, shortness of breath. But they are looking at it because some early reports from China and from ear, nose, and throat surgeons are suggesting that those might be symptoms. So I would say just based on Dr. Fauci's press conference recently and the president's that if you are in a hot spot like New York City and you have those symptoms and it's possible to quarantine yourself, then go ahead and do that to be safe. On the other hand, if you are in parts of the country where there is very little penetration of this illness, it should be OK to go ahead and continue to work. "", 'BAIER: All right, here is a question from James about immunity. ', '(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ', ""UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Hey, Mr. Baier. This is James from Chicago. I'm hearing a lot of information about coronavirus and its relation to the immune system. There's a lot of products I've seen out there that advertise boosting your immune system, or something like that. Is anything like out there helpful, or do those actually work at all? Let me know, thanks. "", '(END VIDEO CLIP) ', 'BAIER: So he just wants some help there, Dr. Cirillo. ', 'CIRILLO: I would say that there are certainly things that we can do to be healthy and to keep our immune systems healthy. Those include healthy diets, diets that include a wide variety of vitamins and minerals. So I would say that the best advice is not just for now but on an ongoing basis is that people should have healthy diets, healthy exercise. Those are the things that help our immune system both today and for the future. ', 'BAIER: Can we answer the question, Dr. Devi, about cardboard and packages you receive and what you should do about the packages? Do you keep them outside? Do you wipe them down? The virus on the cardboard. ', 'NAMPIAPARAMPIL: In the best-case scenario for the virus, they did a study looking at this. These government-funded researchers sprayed the virus in a hair spray type form onto two different surfaces. And in that best-case scenario for the virus it survived for about a day. So for most of us, we are not exposed to virus in that form, so I would say for most people, it should be OK to just take the food or take materials out of the package and then bring it in. But if you are in a hot spot, again, take a little bit more precaution. But this, I would not think, is a major source of spread of this virus. ', 'BAIER: This is from Lola about recoveries. ""Of the people who have tested positive, how many did we know are hospitalized? No symptoms? Mild symptoms? Major systems? Recovered? We need a better perspective."" I think some of this was dealt with, Dr. Anthony, about Tony Fauci about testing and we know and what we don\'t know but. But to her question, do we have any sense of the percentages on those numbers? ', ""CIRILLO: I think it's a great question, Bret, and it raises a question of, we do have data, but I think we on the front lines, particularly in the emergency departments where we are as a team trying to evaluate who is at risk in which patients with symptoms we need to be more cautious around, I think we are all hoping for, as the days go on, that we get more data so that we have a much clearer picture of what truly is the representation of patients who are infected and many of those we suspect may be asymptomatic. But then of those who are sick, how many have mild illness, moderate illness, or severe illness? As we get more data, I think we will be able to better manage not just the health care of those people that we know are infected but really better manage the resources of the health care system. So it's a great question, and we continue to look for more and more data to help answer that. "", 'BAIER: But quickly, Dr. Cirillo, what is your biggest concern on the front lines? ', ""CIRILLO: On the front lines there are two concerns. We need more data about what percentage of the population truly is infected. I think in some ways the more data we get we can be more reassuring to the public. And then the second need is that we still need personal protective equipment. Here in Dade City, Florida, where I'm practicing, we still don't have enough masks. We are rationing them. And I know that across the country, particularly in places like New York that are the most hard hit, they truly have a shortage, and health care workers need more PPE. So those are the two greatest needs for us right now. "", 'BAIER: And that is serious, and Congress hears that, I know. I was just talking to Senator Barrasso. Last thing, Dr. Devi, parents are sometimes pulling their hair out at this point. Gail Henderson, she sent in, ""Is it OK to hug a tree?"" And she\'s got a picture of her son hugging a tree. Is that OK? ', 'NAMPIAPARAMPIL: Yes, that should be safe. That should be safe. ', '(LAUGHTER) ', ""BAIER: It's safe. All right, doctors, thanks so much. We appreciate your time. "", 'CIRILLO: Thank you, Bret. ', 'NAMPIAPARAMPIL: Thank you. ', 'BAIER: When we come back, good news from a bad situation. ', '(COMMERCIAL BREAK) ', 'BAIER: Finally tonight, and every night, we like to end with a few stories to brighten your day, something through the darkness sometimes. In Canada, Helen Lambing was still able to celebrate her 85th birthday, her family showed up across the street from a nursing home, balloons, signs in hand. That is happening a lot nowadays. ', 'And a nursing home in Wales came up with a new activity to lift the residents\' spirits. A life-size version of the game ""Hungry Hungry Hippos."" They made hippo mouths out of plastic baskets, and broomstick handles, and the residents kept themselves pretty busy. You think of some things. You do think of some things when you are holed up.

Thank you for having us.', 'VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE: Thank you, Mark, welcome to the White House.', ""LEVIN: And thank you for everything you're doing. You're the head of the Taskforce the President has set up. Can you give us an example how it works just on a given day, your task force and what kind of members you have on this Taskforce?"", 'PENCE: Well, the President assembled the White House Coronavirus Taskforce very early in the process to organize what he said was a whole of government approach.', ""But as the American people have witnessed and been a part of, it's really become a whole of America approach. We're working with governments at every level. State and local leaders were in continuous contact."", ""But we've assembled the very best health experts. We brought together our top agencies that all deal with health issues and security issues and financial issues, everything in the way the coronavirus is impacting the American people."", ""And we meet every day in the Situation Room. That's where we start. We listen to what the status is from the health experts at this point, with some 10,000 cases at the time that we're speaking. Nearly, half of those cases are in three American counties. And so we've been focusing resources on those areas to really come alongside state and local leaders that are responding to the coronavirus giving them the support they need."", 'But our focus every day is to ensure that the President has the broadest range of policy options, because one thing the American people know about President Donald Trump is he never hesitates to make a decision.', ""In fact, it's so important to say that had the President not suspended all travel from China on January 31st, if he hadn't issued travel advisories for portions of Italy and South Korea and began screening all travelers from all airports in those countries back to the United States now more than six weeks ago, now recently ended all traveled from Europe, the U.K. and Ireland."", ""The truth is, we'd be in a very different place. But the Coronavirus Taskforce's job is to bring together the best health minds, the best leaders of our agency, get the counsel from people that are on the ground and give the President policy choices."", ""And all along the way, the President has been demonstrating that he'll always put the health and safety of America first."", ""LEVIN: You know, I speak as one citizen. Don't I and the American people have a right to be angry with the regime in China for covering up this virus, for really missing its doctors, missing some of its journalists, if I can put it that way, keeping American experts from going to Wuhan to see what was taking place? Don't Americans have a right to be angry with the Chinese government?"", ""PENCE: Well, the President has been very clear that it would have been better if we'd known more sooner. But the truth is that compared to previous outbreaks in China, there's been a much greater degree of transparency on this and we were able to send a team of our health experts in the middle of February to look at the raw data, to understand what's been happening in China."", 'And, we will continue to work on a basis of cooperation, and I would never begrudge Americans feeling the way they feel about any issue, particularly one of such magnitude to our families and to our communities.', ""But what I can tell you is this is a President that has told member, when he tapped me now three and a half weeks ago to lead the White House coronavirus Task Force said we just need to bring the best of America at the Federal level, at the state level, and maybe most importantly, with private industry to respond to this virus and to make sure that we're doing everything in our power to lessen the impact and the spread of the coronavirus on the American people."", 'And most especially, that Americans know that while the risk of serious illness to the average American is quite low, the risk of serious outcomes to seniors with chronic underlying health conditions or anyone with an immunodeficiency is very real.', ""And so every one of us should be putting into practice the President's 15 days to slow the spread recommendation."", 'LEVIN: Where can the public find that?', 'PENCE: At coronavirus.gov. This very straightforward list of recommendations about social distancing, about not eating in restaurants and bars, but using the drive-thru or pickup and delivery service, avoiding gatherings over this period of time of more than 10 people.', ""Certainly, it's about making sure that fewer Americans contract the coronavirus, but we recognize that most people that contract the coronavirus will either have flu-like symptoms or in many cases, no symptoms at all."", ""But this is about not just protecting your health and the health of your family. It's about making sure that you don't inadvertently expose someone who would be quite vulnerable."", 'Again, seniors with serious underlying health conditions, or anyone with an immunodeficiency. It represents the possibility of serious consequences.', ""So we are asking every American to put into practice the President's guidelines because we really believe -- and Dr. Tony Fauci, Dr. Deborah Birx -- the top experts in the world on Infectious Disease, tell us, Mark that we are we are at the beginning point of this epidemic in America."", 'And if all of us will do these things now, we believe that we can significantly reduce the spread of the coronavirus in America, which would spare millions of Americans enduring the virus and it would save lives.', ""LEVIN: Let me ask you a tough question about the economy. You're a conservative. I'm a conservative. Lots of money being talked about out there. Trillion dollar package, broken up in various ways, heard the Treasury Secretary talk about up to $3,000.00 or more a family in one shot, then a second shot."", ""I heard Chuck Schumer on Capitol Hill, of course, it's not enough for the left and the Democrats have all kinds of plans. They talk about universal healthcare and so forth."", ""Here's my concern. I understand that this is a temporary situation, that it is a historically bad situation. How can we reassure Americans out there who like our economic system, who don't think the Federal government should be subsidizing everyone and backing everyone and love our Constitution? That we'll get back to normalcy once this is done."", ""I understand you and the President. But there's another party out there and there's another agenda out there potentially."", 'PENCE: Well, I think they can look at the first two Bills the President has now signed into law with great encouragement.', 'You know, I served in Congress for 12 years and, you know, usually extraneous issues and agendas come to bear. But I will tell you, on our first Bill, making sure that all of our Federal and state agencies have resources, Republicans and Democrats really came together and really focused on what was necessary to respond to the coronavirus.', 'The Bill the President passed this week extending paid family leave particularly to hourly workers and blue collar Americans, making coronavirus testing free for every American again was very focused at the point of the need.', 'And, and I remain confident that as we go forward, that same spirit, as President Trump said will continue to dominate our legislative efforts.', 'The President, though is -- President recognizes the unique burden that this is placing on working families, on businesses, especially small businesses, and we want to do whatever it takes to help working families and businesses large and small, some of our critical industries weather the coronavirus.', 'But when we come out of the end of it, Mark, we just know this economy is going to come roaring back. Our economy had been stronger than ever before, and all the fundamentals are still there, and the President and I and all of our economic team are convinced that it will be there, first, for working families who through no fault of their own suddenly find themselves worried about missing a paycheck.', 'If we make sure and provide our healthcare providers with the resources and the American people the guidance to deal with the coronavirus.', ""If we backstop our major industries so that they know whether it be airlines or whether it be our hotels and resorts or whether it be even the cruise line industry that they all know that they'll be able to weather this storm, that once we come through it, I know we'll be more prosperous than ever before and these temporary measures to deal with this unprecedented epidemic in our country, I believe will be seen as having been the right thing to do."", 'LEVIN: You know, you are governor. Governors are in charge of the healthcare systems in their state. Three dozen states at least. They have a system in place where you have to certify the hospital beds if they want to have more beds.', ""If they want to build more hospitals. They want MRI machines or CT machine. All that comes through the Governor's Office. He has to approve all of these things."", 'When it comes to residents, future doctors, particularly related to Medicare; Congress, sets the limit on how many residents there can be related to Medicare funding.', ""And I hear some Governor's saying we need more beds. We need more of this. We need more of that. And I'm just saying, okay, go get them because they have the legal authority to do it."", ""Do you see what's going on now, with this virus sort of modernizing or waking up governors in particular and changing our system of healthcare -- which is the greatest -- but sort of bringing it into this century under you and the President of the United States?"", 'PENCE: Well, I have to tell you, I think the fact that I have been a governor was one of the main reasons that President Trump asked me to lead the White House Coronavirus Taskforce, Mark.', 'Because I knew from personal experience in the State of Indiana, what happens when an infectious disease emerges? One of the first Middle East Respiratory cases in the country came to Northwest Indiana when I was governor and I saw the way our frontline healthcare workers surged forward. I saw the way our state health team came around it.', 'We worked with law enforcement. We did the contact tracing. We provided the care and the treatment.', 'And the Federal government came in and gave us all the guidance we needed from the C.D.C. and ultimately helped us with resources to backfill what the State of Indiana had done.', ""My experience there taught me what most Americans know is that, it is our local health officials. It's our state governors and our governments there in the lead in confronting health challenges in our communities."", ""And that's why the President just this last week, stood up a famous National Response Center, because we want all 50 states to know that we're going to follow the FEMA model."", ""The President declared a national emergency. He signed what you understand to be the Stafford Act, and now with FEMA in the lead, we're going to operate in a way where our response to the coronavirus is going to be locally executed, state managed and federally supported."", ""We've been in continuous contact with governors, spoke on conference calls to all of our nation's governors in states and territories this week, and I will tell you that while there have been governors that have been expressing needs publicly, I couldn't be more impressed with the leadership that we have seen, particularly in states that have been impacted greatly by the coronavirus today."", ""And I also couldn't be more impressed with the truly bipartisan spirit. I mean President Trump has forged a seamless partnership with our governors who in ordinary political times, we have our differences, but the President has made it very, very clear, we're all in this together."", ""We've been working closely with our governors. We've been listening to their needs, empowering them and encouraging them to reach out to their healthcare providers and into their supply lines to meet those needs. And we'll continue to work."", ""That's what the President called a whole of government approach from early on. It wasn't just the whole of the Federal government. But it is taking in the fact that the state governments are in the lead, our local healthcare providers are on the front line, and making sure along with private industry that we're bringing all of the strength of America to respond to the coronavirus."", ""LEVIN: We'll be right back."", '(COMMERCIAL BREAK)', 'LEVIN: Welcome back. Mr. Vice President, let me ask you a question. You must be very impressed with the private sector, with these experts in the Federal government, with our federalism system, with our capitalism system, with Americanism. All the elements of our society which are not centralized.', ""You're the Taskforce Chief. You must see all these different pieces, people doing their part without some Svengali telling them exactly what to do."", ""And here's something else I noticed, Mr. Vice President. That our President is respectful of boundaries, that he has respect for the Constitution. He has been -- he was criticized for being a dictator. And now many of the same people criticize him, and they don't want him to be a dictator. And he, I think is much more prudential."", ""He is saying no, I'm going to do everything I can. But we're not going to break glasses around here. Do I have that about right?"", ""PENCE: Well, I think what you have right is that America is up to the task, and they have a President who knows that. Not that there aren't challenges ahead, Mark, there are."", ""And there's heartache ahead. I mean, as we continue to roll out testing by the by the tens of thousands more tests done every day, we will learn of more cases. And sadly, we'll learn have more loss of life."", 'But President Trump from very early on has understood that the American people would come together around our response and that our state and local officials, our incredible health experts at the Federal level, now empowering the American people, we will find our way through this.', ""And I hear about the way people are responding all across the country. And I must tell you, I'm inspired, but I'm not surprised. I mean, we're Americans after all."", ""We're people that that embrace personal responsibility, and we look after our neighbors, but to hear to hear the stories of how people who are not only putting their own health and their family's health first, but how they're looking after the most vulnerable, how they have been willing to embrace the guidelines the President has put forward, understanding who is most at risk of the coronavirus."", ""And maybe -- and I don't know that it has gotten enough attention to see the way American businesses are responding. It has truly been inspiring."", 'I mean, the President had this call on construction firms around the country to donate industrial masks to hospitals because the President had changed the law this week that allowed industrial masks to be used by our healthcare workers. That opened up a floodgate of new medical protective equipment, so our healthcare workers can provide care to people with the coronavirus and still keep themselves and their families safe.', ""And we're hearing stories in the first 24 hours of construction companies around America that are literally emptying their supply houses, delivering crates of medical masks to their local hospital."", ""But one industry after another, whether it be the health insurance industry that agreed at the President's request to waive all copays on coronavirus, whether it be the nursing home industry that rose up and immediately embraced all new guidelines that we directed them, have been communicating to seniors and their nursing homes or long term care, whether it be the willing spirit of one industry after another, to make sure that we have the supply lines open."", 'To hear the grocery stores that we spoke to just in the last week, say that our supply for food is the best in the world and that system is all working and the grocery stores has said however long this takes, your local grocery store will stay open.', ""I mean, Americans understandably, we are anxious and some people were buying a large amount of food and household goods, but we're seeing that change around the country because people understand now that our grocery stores and all their hard working employees have said, we're keeping the doors open all the way through the coronavirus."", ""And many grocery stores, recognizing that seniors are the most vulnerable among us in many cases, now how hours for seniors to come and shop so they don't have to mix with the broader population."", ""I mean, these are the things that the American people are doing without being asked and as the President and I speak literally every day with healthcare leaders and providers, I had great meeting with doctors and nurses earlier this week, as we speak to industry leaders, I couldn't be more proud to be an American, to see the way the American people and American businesses are rising to the challenge."", ""And I know we'll get through this, as the President says, we'll get through this together."", ""LEVIN: I want to thank you.

But I remember seeing you all the time whenever there's some horrific disease, there you are on TV."", ""FAUCI: Well, I've been Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases for almost 36 years, but I've been at the N.I.H. from the time I first came after my medical training in New York City, Internal Medicine, I did an Infectious Diseases fellowship at the N.I.H. in 1968 to 1971."", ""And then I went back for a year in New York City to do medical -- extensive medical training -- and then I came back, and I've been here ever since. So it's about 50 years."", ""LEVIN: So you've seen some pretty nasty viruses, some pretty nasty illnesses. Have you ever seen anything like this?"", ""FAUCI: You know, all the outbreaks that I've been involved with that go all the way back from HIV-AIDS, which when you look at the impact of that, over time, it started sort of like not very well noticed back in the early 1980s, and it was a lot under the radar screen because people were infected and didn't know it. They weren't obviously ill."", 'And then you get to today, where you have, you know, historically one of the most impactful outbreaks in the history of civilization.', ""That's different than the here. We've had Ebola. We've had the anthrax attacks. We've had Chikungunya, we've had the threat of the chicken pre- pandemic flu, the bird flu, the H5N1. We've had Ebola. We've had Zika."", ""This is different, because this really is very much the unknown of what is going to happen and what you see unfold isn't particularly encouraging."", ""If you look at what's happened in China. If you look at what's happened in South Korea, and now currently in Europe, you know, you're having a very serious situation that potentially involves everyone in the world and everyone in the United States."", 'When we had Ebola, I mean, there was a lot of publicity and a lot of concern about Ebola. But the nature of how Ebola spreads, is that it would never really have ever been a massive outbreak in the United States.', ""Because with Ebola, you have to be in very close contact with someone who is very ill, obviously ill, and you have to be in touch with what's called body fluids."", ""So even though it's a scary disease, there was really no chance there would be a major outbreak, maybe a couple of patients that we saw."", ""This disease is different because it's a respiratory illness. It's an illness that spread rapidly from person to person, and it has a substantial degree of morbidity and mortality."", ""For example, if you use as a benchmark, you compare it with seasonal flu, which we have every year and we get used to it as much illness and death that it causes, you're kind of used to it, you know, it comes every single year. The mortality of that is 0.1 percent."", 'The mortality of this infection in China and in Korea was about two to three percent.', ""Now, I think the ultimate mortality when we find out that many people are infected, but don't get noticed because their infection is asymptomatic, it will probably be less than two to three percent."", ""But whatever it is, it's going to be much higher than the kinds of things that we've experienced. So for that reason, it is clearly, clearly different."", ""LEVIN: Well, let me ask you a question, putting the statistics aside. I get the flu last year, then I get this virus this year. For me as an individual putting aside how it spreads and all the rest of it, what's the difference?"", 'FAUCI: Well, the difference is the potential for killing you and the potential for putting you in a situation where you would require very intensive medical care.', 'Now, influenza is similar in some respects to coronavirus, in that the people who have complications when they get infected are generally the elderly, and particularly those who have underlying conditions, congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, or people who are on chemotherapy for underlying conditions, like cancer or autoimmune diseases. They have very heavily weighted towards the serious consequences.', ""The difference between influenza and this besides the fact that the morbidity of this and mortality is much greater than influenza, is that for reasons that we don't understand, this particular virus doesn't really do very much bad things to kids, children."", ""Children seem to do very, very well. Now, every once in a while, you're going to get a one-off where a young person or a child gets seriously ill and maybe even dies."", ""But for the most part, children do very well. But I think if you just want to be sort of plain and simple about it, it's a much more serious disease than classical influenza."", 'LEVIN: Except for healthy people tend to do okay in the end, correct?', 'FAUCI: Yes, if you look at again, every day and every week that goes by, we learn more and more. Initially, our store of knowledge came predominantly from China. Then when South Korea and Japan and other Asian countries got infected, we looked at what happened there.', ""Now we have a lot of data from Europe because Italy and France and the European countries, and now we're starting to accumulate thousands of patients in our own country. So as the weeks go by, we learn more and more."", ""But if you look at the display of the ages of people who get into trouble, without a doubt, if you're a young, healthy person, you might get infected, you might feel ill, but the overwhelming possibility is that you're going to spontaneously recover without any specific kind of medical intervention."", ""LEVIN: We'll be right back."", '(COMMERCIAL BREAK)', 'LEVIN: This virus looks for opportunities.', 'FAUCI: Right.', ""LEVIN: And if you have a weakness, whether a result of age, or poor immunity, or whatever it is, that's where it becomes more dangerous. But for the general population that is generally healthy, it is not necessarily a morbidity issue, correct?"", ""FAUCI: It's not a morbidity issue, but the reason why we insist that everybody take precautions about getting infected because even though for a younger person, that person may not have a high chance of morbidity and mortality, that person can easily get infected as well as anybody else."", 'And as part of the goal and the mission of addressing this outbreak is to A, prevent infections in anybody and everybody, but also to protect the vulnerable, the people who if they get infected, they have a much poorer outcome.', ""And unfortunately, young people who may feel that they're invulnerable. I know when I was young, I kind of felt that I was invulnerable. Well, first of all, you're not invulnerable, but certainly you're much less likely to get into trouble, but you could then pass the virus inadvertently to an elderly person, maybe your grandfather and grandmother, to a sick relative who may have chemotherapy."", ""And even though you're saying, well, you know, I'm not going to get sick, I'm going to do fine. I feel as a physician and as a public health person, that you have a societal responsibility to protect yourself from getting infected for two reasons."", ""One, you don't want to get sick, even though it's a mild to moderate illness. And two, you really want to protect the vulnerable people in society."", ""LEVIN: I think that's right. I'm just trying to point out that these statistics that people are getting panicky, and that it might be increased over the flu and so forth. It's really certain populations in particular, the behavior you know, that's right, people need to behave in a way that they don't make relatives, friends and others strangers sick."", ""Let me ask you this. I keep hearing we don't have enough beds. We don't have enough ventilators. We don't have enough respirators. And I did a little research, you can straighten me out if I'm wrong."", ""We have what's called these CON Laws in 36 states in the District of Columbia. These are Certificate of Need Laws, where the governors, the states decide how many ICU beds there are going to be. How many hospitals are going to be? Whether a hospital can build another wing -- all goes through these state regulatory processes."", 'When you have a bed, a bed is not useful unless you have a ventilator or a respirator, and of course, you need doctors and nurses. Then I look at this doctor issue, again, just as a pedestrian.', 'You have Medicare-funded residency slots that are set by Congress. So Congress is setting many of these residency slots. The states are determining how many beds there are.', 'And so at these press conferences, you and the President and others are asked, what are you going to do about the beds? What are you going to do about respirators and so forth?', ""Isn't this virus showing some of the gaps in our system? And isn't the response to it when we look back actually going to help fix some of that perhaps?"", ""FAUCI: Yes. Well, you know, you've asked a good, but complicated question. So first of all, everything that you just asked me about is, as we speak, almost being directly addressed by the President and the Vice President in their discussions at the meetings in our Taskforce, and at the innumerable press conferences that we have."", 'First of all, what can the Federal government do? As you can see, the President has over the last few days has called upon the Department of Defense to supply millions and millions and millions of mask respirators. Many, many, many more ventilators that we have.', ""They're bringing in beds with regard to the naval ships that now will be deployed. They're providing financial assistance for people who are going to be in difficulty because of the virus."", 'But the other thing that was stressed and stressed very clearly, the second point you made, and that is -- this is something that needs to be implemented and is the responsibility of the states and the local.', ""So sometimes they don't even realize that they have the resources and it's up to them to make the decisions about implementation. But the Federal government does, it went out there, they clearly are not enough. They are willing and able to help."", ""But the actual on the ground implementation of it is at the local and state level. That's the reason why the President has met and I've been on telephone calls with him with the governors more than once to try and get them to appreciate that is it within their reach and within their power to make these kinds of decisions to see if resources can be properly distributed."", ""That's not saying that we'll always have enough for everyone, and that's the reason why he is calling on the people in the industry to rev up, to make some of these things, to fill -- to backfill the Strategic National Stockpile."", ""You know, because we have 12,700, ventilators in the Strategic National Stockpile, we have tens of millions of respirator masks. Once you send them out to those who need it, you have to backfill, and those are the kind of things they're doing."", 'Bottom line, everything you just said now is being very intensively addressed, both by the President and the Vice President and the administration and the Taskforce, as well as at the local level.', ""LEVIN: The only reason I mentioned it, is because I watch these press conferences with the governors, and I watched the Governor of New York say we need more beds and I said, well, why don't you go get them? Because under the these CON Laws, the Certificate of Need Laws and the first state to have it was New York in the 1960s. They limit the number of beds for whatever reason, they limit the expansion of facilities and not just that, MRIs, CTs, other devices."", ""I am only mentioning this so the American people understand, you sitting here can't snap your finger and then all of a sudden there's more beds and the President of the United States can snap his finger."", 'FAUCI: Right.', ""LEVIN: We'll be right back."", '(COMMERCIAL BREAK)', ""LEVIN: Welcome back. Dr. Fauci, let me ask you a question. You've been doing this a long time. Have you ever seen this big of a coordinated response by an administration to such a threat? A health threat?"", ""FAUCI: Well, we've never had a threat like this and the coordinated response has been, there are a number of adjectives to describe it. Impressive, I think is one of them."", ""I mean, we're talking about all-hands on-deck is that I, as one of many people on a team, I'm not the only person, since the beginning that we even recognized what this was. I have been devoting almost full time on this -- almost full time."", ""I'm down at the White House virtually every day with the Taskforce. I'm connected by phone throughout the day and into the night and when I say night, I'm talking twelve, one, two in the morning. I'm not the only one. There's a whole group of us that are doing that. It's every single day."", ""So I can't imagine that that under any circumstances that anybody could be doing more. I mean, obviously, we're fighting a formidable enemy -- this virus. This virus is a serious issue here."", ""Take a look at what it's done to China, to Europe, to South Korea. It is serious and our response is aimed, and I know you've heard that many, many times, and this is true. I mean, I deal with viruses my entire career."", ""When you have an outbreak virus, if you leave it to its own devices, it will peak up and then come back down. What we learned from China, that letting it peak up is really bad, because it can do some serious damage. So we are focused now, like a laser on doing whatever we can, and there are two or three things that deserve to be mentioned -- to make this peak actually be a mound, which means you're going to have suffering, you're going to have illness, you're going to have death. But it's not going to be the maximum that the virus can do."", 'A couple of ways to do that. The first was, as we say, all the time, the very timely decision on the part of the President to shut off travel from China, because we saw that there was this possibility of people coming in and seeding in the country. We did it early.', ""And as it turned out, there were relatively few cases in the big picture of things that came in from China. Unfortunately, for our colleagues, and many of whom are my friends and people I've trained actually in Medicine, in European countries, they didn't do that. And they got hit really hard and are being hit really hard. The first thing."", 'Second thing, when the infection burden shifted from China to Europe, we did the same thing with Europe. We shut off travel from Europe, which again was another safeguard to prevent influx from without in.', ""The other way you do it is by containment and mitigation. And now everybody knows what the word mitigation means because it's the things that we're doing. No crowds, work from home. Don't go to places that you can be susceptible. Ten people in a room, not 50 and a hundred people. Stay away from theatres."", 'Take the elderly people who are susceptible and have them do self- isolation. Stay out of bars, stay out of restaurants.', ""If you're in an area where there's a lot of coronavirus activity, close the bars, close the restaurants. That's heavy duty mitigation."", ""So I think with all of those things going on at the same time, I believe we will -- we're already doing it, but you just can't notice it yet because you have the dynamics of the virus going up. We're trying to put it down. You're not really sure quantitatively what you're doing, but you can be actually certain that we're having an impact on it."", ""LEVIN: We'll be right back."", '(COMMERCIAL BREAK)', ""LEVIN: You are impressed, every day, 20 hours a day of what's taking place. How about the private sector? Are you impressed with their reaction?"", ""FAUCI: Well, I'm impressed with the fact that when the President called the private sector into the Cabinet Room and into the Roosevelt Room and said we need to step up that that allowed us to have a lot more bandwidth if you want to call it that."", 'I mean, particularly with the idea of what we were stalling early on a bit with the testing, they said, okay, we need high throughput testing, we need the companies that make it to get it out there and can implement that.', ""And to their credit, the company stepped to the plate. So that's the reason why we are seeing and we'll be seeing quite soon, a major escalation in the ability to be doing testing."", ""LEVIN: There is this statement put up, some in the press, some in the opposition party of the President, that the President doesn't follow the science. Is the President following the science?"", ""FAUCI: Every single time that I -- and when I say every day, it's like almost every day. It's not like once a month. We are in the in the Taskforce meeting. There are several of us, myself included. I'm not the only one that's a scientist or a public health person. There are other people who have other responsibilities, so we get a good sampling of expertise that you need and it's led by the Vice President, Secretary Azar is there as the Secretary of H.H.S."", ""And we talk about every aspect and we make all of our decisions and recommendations that are based on the science. I have never in that room had a situation where I said, scientifically, this is the right thing to do it and they said, don't do it. Or scientifically, this is the wrong thing to do and they did it anyway."", ""Then we get up and we present it to the President. And he asks a lot of questions. That's his nature. He is constantly asking the question, and I never, in the multiple times that I've done that, where I said, for scientific reasons, we really should do this that he hasn't said let's do it."", ""Or when he's decided -- not decided -- when he suggests, why don't we do this? And I say, no, that's really not a good idea from a scientific standpoint. He has never overruled me."", ""LEVIN: All right. Well, keep up the great work. Let everybody that you work with know that the American people are very thankful you're out there and we will continue to watch and God bless you."", 'FAUCI: Thank you very much.

', ""And joining us now from the campaign trail in Alabama, former Vice President Joe Biden. \xa0Mr. Vice President, congratulations on your victory in South Carolina last night. What do you think it does for your campaign? \xa0BIDEN: Well, I think it's a big boost. I think it starts the -- a real comeback and I think it -- we picked up a lot of delegates practically speaking, and we now have amassed more popular vote than anyone running for the nomination but we have a long, long way to go. This is a marathon. \xa0WALLACE: Well, let me ask you about that because now you face Super Tuesday in just 48 hours where 44 percent of the delegates will be allocated. And, frankly, you're at a big disadvantage going into there. "", 'Let me count the ways. ', ""You haven't held a rally in a Super Tuesday state in more than a month. In California, Bernie Sanders has 23 offices and more a hundred staffers. You have one office and your campaign won't say how many staffers. And while Sanders is spending $13.5 million on TV ads for Tuesday you started running your first ad this week. "", ""Question, if you get clobbered on Super Tuesday, what does that do to your campaign? \xa0BIDEN: Well, it certainly doesn't help, but there's a lot of big states coming up after that, Florida and Georgia and Pennsylvania and Michigan. I mean, a whole range of states that still are in play. "", ""But I -- look, I'm not pundit, Chris, and I'm not being a wise guy. I'm being -- I'm being deadly earnest. I feel good about where we are and I think ultimately, people are now beginning to focus on the opposition in the way that they focused on the -- in the Democratic Party, the way they've been focused on me for a long time. \xa0And I think that -- I think it's about the message and I think that people know who I am, although I've been outspent 41-to-1, I think it was -- or 40-to-1 in South Carolina and other places. I think we've now began to raise money, nothing like they have raised. "", ""We have raised about $18 million this month, just $5 million overnight, and so, I think things are picking up, but we'll see. \xa0WALLACE: And talking about money, Mayor Bloomberg has bought TV time on two networks tonight to deliver a primetime address -- three-minute primetime address to the nation. "", ""How do you compete with that? \xa0BIDEN: I'm on your show. By doing as much of the free press and earned media as I can. I'm being serious. "", ""And, look, I think that, you know, money can buy a lot but it can't -- it can't hide your record and it can't make you something that you are or are not. And -- so I just think --one of the best things that I think happening is now, Mike is a solid, serious guy. He's in the debates now, and we're able to discuss the differences we have. "", ""But I think the Democratic Party is looking for a Democrat, not a socialist, not a former Republican, a Democrat to -- to be their nominee and to bring the country together in a way that I've been able to do my whole career. \xa0WALLACE: Speaking of Democratic socialist, how damaging do you think Bernie Sanders would be on the top of the ticket, both in terms of trying to beat Donald Trump and also for Democrats down ballot? \xa0BIDEN: Well, look, if he's the nominee, I will support him, but I think it makes it very difficult down ballot. And this is no great secret to anybody, you can't run as an independent socialist, now a Democratic socialist, and do particularly -- expect to do very well in the states we have to win, like North Carolina, like Georgia, like Florida, like Texas, like Pennsylvania, et cetera. \xa0And so I -- look, I believe that if I'm on the top of the ticket, we will win back the Senate and we'll keep the House. I went in last time in 2018 to 24 purple states, we won 41 House seats, we won governor seats. I was invited in, I don't know that they invited the -- Bernie Sanders to come in, not because he's a bad guy, but he comes from a different perspective. "", ""Look, the people aren't looking for revolution, they're looking for results. But he talks about a revolution. Let's get results, and the idea that Bernie's going to be able to come up with $60 trillion in 10 years to do the things he wants, there's no -- there's really no path there. \xa0And I can get that done on health care by building on Obamacare with a Biden Medicare option in it. I can do this in terms of Ebola -- I mean, excuse me, in terms of dealing with the issues that relate to what we put together when we faced the pandemic of Ebola, I've had the experience of doing that. I can do this in terms of bringing together the world with regard to climate change and so on. \xa0So, I -- this is -- these are things that have been in my wheelhouse, things that I've done. And I have a record of real success. \xa0Bernie doesn't have much of a record at all as accomplishments in the United States Senate and United States Congress. He's done a few things. He's worked with John McCain on health care -- excuse me, on veterans' issues, and post office is another thing. \xa0But I've passed big legislation. I'm able to cross the aisle and I've been able to get things done. \xa0WALLACE: Mr. Vice President, if Sanders is such a threat to the Democratic Party and the possibility of Democratic majorities, should all of the centrists get together? \xa0I know you have a pretty clogged lane. There's you, there's Bloomberg, there's Buttigieg, there's Klobuchar. \xa0Should you get together after Super Tuesday and however is in the lead amongst you, whoever has the most delegates, all the other say, we're going to get out and we're going to support this moderate to go one-on-one against Bernie Sanders? \xa0BIDEN: Well, you know, it's kind of interesting, on your show, for me to be called a moderate, Chris. I know it's 13 years since I've been on, but I've never been called a moderate on your show before, and I don't consider myself -- including myself -- \xa0WALLACE: A relative moderate. \xa0(LAUGHTER) \xa0(CROSSTALK) \xa0BIDEN: You know what I mean, and I'm not criticizing you (ph). \xa0I'm making the point that I have a very, very progressive record and the issue is what we -- what can get done. \xa0And, look, it's not for me to tell any other candidate that they should get out of the race. They'll know whether or not they remain viable, whether they have a chance. And I'm confident that the primaries that are coming up and the ones that follow are going to winnow that field. And -- and I think people will do the right thing. But I'm not going to presume to tell anybody to get out (ph). \xa0(CROSSTALK) \xa0WALLACE: Well, let me ask you a question directly then. If Super Tuesday ends and there's another so-called moderate or a centrist who's leading you in delegates, would you consider getting out to give them a clear path against Sanders? \xa0BIDEN: Well, look, I'm not going to -- I'm not going to speculate on any of those kinds of things. I think we're going to do well. I know I am running. I'm not running against any of the Democrats. I'm running against this -- what -- what our present president is doing and what he stands for and I'm going to stay in my message. \xa0And I've started off saying we have to restore the dignity and honor of the office and the soul of this country, to gain respect in the country and around the world. We have to deal with bringing -- reestablishing the middle class and bringing everybody along, including the poor having an opportunity to get up, and as well we have to unite the country. \xa0And I used to be criticized for saying all these -- all those three things when I started. Now we know most Democrats are saying the same thing. \xa0Who can get it done? Who can put his country together? Who can restore the dignity and honor of the country, from my perspective anyway? \xa0WALLACE: Mr. Biden -- \xa0BIDEN: And I think -- and I'm best equipped to do that. \xa0WALLACE: Mr. Vice President, I don't especially like asking you about this, but it is an issue in the campaign and that has been your sometimes shaky performance on the campaign trail. \xa0Here's a story that you told at least three times about Nelson Mandela. Take a look. \xa0(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) \xa0BIDEN: I had the great honor of meeting him. I had a great honor of being arrested with our U.N. ambassador on the streets of Soweto trying to get to see him on Robbens Island. \xa0(END VIDEO CLIP) \xa0WALLACE: You now say you weren't arrested and that it didn't happen in Soweto. You were at the airport in Johannesburg and you were stopped from going through the door for blacks. "", ""I guess the question is, were you confused or were you just trying to embellish a story? \xa0BIDEN: No. No, what I was trying to -- what I was doing was talking about the fact that I was strongly opposed to apartheid. When we landed and -- we were going to Soweto actually. We landed in Johannesburg and the Afrikaners took me off the plane and took me into one direction, wanted me to go through a white-only door, and in fact, I wouldn't move. I said everybody else is going through to another door, I'm going with the -- with the black delegation that I came with. "", ""They said, no, you can't. And I said, I'm staying here, I'm not going to move. And they would not let me move anywhere so I guess I should have said, I was -- I was detained, I was not able to move forward. \xa0So what they finally did was they went out, and they cleared out a baggage claim area, took us all up through the baggage claim area, up through -- cleared out a restaurant. "", ""Look and if anybody wonders whether or not what I said about my desire, my adamancy about apartheid, you've covered it. Go back and look at joebiden.com and take a look at the -- \xa0WALLACE: No, no. \xa0(CROSSTALK) \xa0BIDEN: -- happened in the -- \xa0WALLACE: Your record is clear. \xa0(CROSSTALK) \xa0WALLACE: Let me ask you though -- here's something else you said this week. Take a look. \xa0(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) \xa0BIDEN: I'm a Democratic candidate for the United States Senate. Look me over. If you like what you see, help out. If not, vote for the other guy (ph). Give me a look though, OK? \xa0(END AUDIO CLIP) \xa0WALLACE: You haven't run for the Senate since 2008. What happened there? \xa0BIDEN: Well, the context was I said to everybody -- I said look I'm going to say the same things I've always said, like I used to campaign in Delaware. I'd say, knocking the door, I said, my name is Joe Biden, Democratic candidate for the United States Senate. Look me over, if you like me help me out. If not, vote for the other guy. "", ""That's the -- a sentence I've repeated throughout making the case and I sent -- and I'm here now to ask you all to look me over. It was in the context of how I said I ran because -- the context is also was that you can't -- as was pointed out by my -- Cedric and others on my campaign and how I ran when I ran for the Senate was people will not -- they expect you to ask them. You have to earn their vote. That was the context for that. \xa0WALLACE: All right. Final question in this regard. "", ""President Trump went after you about this at CPAC yesterday.

', ""How much can his win -- Biden's win in South Carolina make up for the deficits and all of those, especially given the fact that millions of people have been voting already, early voting in those Super Tuesday states? "", ""KRISTEN SOLTIS ANDERSON, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Look, everybody loves a winner, having this momentum is very valuable for him. It is helping keep his campaign afloat. But with the short time frame, the problem he's going to have is, I still believe the Biden campaign does not have a clear and concise message in the way that someone like Bernie Sanders does. "", ""If you ask what Bernie Sanders is about, it's easy. It's revolution for the 99 percent. "", ""WALLACE: Al right. Let me just push back. Biden would say it's results, not revolution. "", 'SOLTIS ANDERSON: Yes, and I just wonder, is that inspirational enough? Is that the sort of thing that gets people excited, as motivated? Does it hit the right emotional buttons? ', ""I think that Bernie Sanders, because he's got this movement behind him, this is my he's going to go into Super Tuesday and still be able to pull together so many delegates from states like California, from places like Texas, the polls show that he is still doing quite well, particularly among younger voters, but as long as he can still divide up the older voters within the Democratic Party, it's going to be hard for anyone to challenge him, even once they get past Super Tuesday. "", 'WALLACE: Mo, how do you handicap the race now? Just after South Carolina, Super Tuesday, about to come upon us. And as -- forgive me, as a more mainstream Democrat, how much do you worry about Bernie Sanders at the top of the ticket? ', ""MO ELLEITHEE, GEORGETOWN INSTITUTE OF POLITICS & PUBLIC SERVICE: I think, right now, Bernie probably is still the front runner. But he's a little bit less of a front runner today than he was yesterday morning, and I do think this is a momentum business. And when you get a nice bounce out of a state like South Carolina, a pretty big bounce, I mean, it was a good old- fashioned shellacking in South Carolina, that can help in a lot of the states Donna just mentioned. "", ""The wild card -- there are two wild cards. One is the early vote as Kristen talked about, the other is Mike Bloomberg, Mike Bloomberg got into this race saying he was going to be the last line of defense against Bernie Sanders. But, we're not seeing him really sort of take the lead yet. No one has voted for him yet. "", ""But the polling in each of these Super Tuesday states showing he's not doing well enough to beat Bernie, but he is doing well enough to stop someone else from beating Bernie. "", ""So, Mike Bloomberg could have gone from being the last line of defense against Bernie to being Bernie's last line of defense against Biden. "", ""WALLACE: Let me pick up on that with you, Katie, because there is polling that shows that socialism is not the buzzword that it has traditionally been for some voters, especially younger voters. Do you think it's possible, first in the Democratic primary, then in a general election for Bernie Sanders to make socialism mainstream? "", ""KATIE PAVLICH, TOWNHALL.COM EDITOR: I think he already has. If you look at the way that young people view the word socialism, even though they can't always define exactly what that means, you look at the number of people in these FOX News voter analysis polls that we have been doing, what they actually believe in. They line up with a lot of what Bernie Sanders is pushing with his platform which is socialism. "", ""I would add that Bernie Sanders and his record, especially over the past week, defending the Castro regime, his record personally of honeymooning in the USSR, that was communism, not just Democratic socialism as he likes to say. So, that is something, certainly he's been able to take mainstream in the Democratic Party. Whether he can do that nationally, I'm not sure. "", ""But what he is good at doing is building coalition. The question for Joe Biden now, going forward, is he going to be able to find a James Clyburn in every single Super Tuesday state to get him over the edge? I know we're all celebrating that Joe Biden finally won a primary after three times running for president, but if he had not one, his campaign would be over. And the question now is, is he going to be able to make enough money over the next 48 hours to have some momentum going into the states? "", 'And -- ', ""WALLACE: Even if you raised the money, you can't spend it. "", ""PAVLICH: Right, right. The airwaves are already taken up by other -- by other candidates. And also, if you look at Nevada and the way that Bernie Sanders came out of that with the coalition, a diverse coalition, and the fact that people are already voting for him in places like California and Colorado, and how he's -- right behind Joe Biden in Texas, this is still something that Joe Biden has to worry about, and whether he can expand the coalition at this point is a real big question. "", 'WALLACE: We should also point out, for all the talk about how Iowa and New Hampshire were untypical states because they were 90 percent white, South Carolina is also an untypical state because the electorate there in that primary last night was over 50 percent African-American. ', ""Final question to you, Kristen, we've got about a minute left. What does polling say about how tough it will be to sell socialism, not communism, but socialism to majority of Americans? "", ""SOLTIS ANDERSON: So, FOX News's owned polling from just this week shows it's only about 3 out of 10 voters say they would be comfortable with someone who is a socialist being president, that only about a third of America is OK with socialism. But socialism is defined very differently for younger voters versus older voters, as Katie was mentioning. "", ""I think, in terms of the word socialism, lots of voters don't like it, but the idea of the government providing very extensive health care benefits, et cetera, a lot of voters are actually much more on board with that. I would not count out the ideological places American voters may be willing to go. "", ""WALLACE: You know, it's also interesting.

', ""WALLACE: What's the latest count of coronavirus cases in the U.S. of unknown origin where, at this point, the only explanation is community spread?\xa0 AZAR: You bet. "", ""So we've got about -- we've had 23 cases here in the United States that are not a result of us repatriating individuals from Japan or China. Of those individuals, we've got cases in Chicago, as well as Washington and Oregon where we do -- and two in California where we do not yet know why they contracted the novel coronavirus.\xa0 So we're deployed with state and local people, and we're working to get to the bottom of it.\xa0 WALLACE: So -- so we knew about the cases on the West Coast. There's now one in Chicago as well?\xa0 AZAR: There -- there is one overnight in Chicago, yes.\xa0 WALLACE: And did the man who died from the illness in Washington State, did he get it, best of your knowledge, from community spread? And what can you tell us about this nursing home in Kirkland, Washington?\xa0 AZAR: So at this point we do not know how this gentleman contracted the illness. And we're -- obviously want to express our sympathies to him and to -- on behalf of him and his family for this fatality. "", ""He is in a -- he was in a hospital. This hospital is one where the nursing home sends patients. There are cases in that nursing home also. So right now there's a large investigation going on in the nursing home, the hospital, contact tracing to try to determine where that disease was introduced and how it might have spread.\xa0 WALLACE: But you don't know. So, at this point, this is a community transmission, which means it's somewhere out in that community, in Kirkland, Washington?\xa0 AZAR: At this point it's a suspected community transmission, yes.\xa0 WALLACE: And that's concerning, right?\xa0 AZAR: Any community transmission is concerning. That's why we've been very clear from the outset, we're going to have more cases here in the United States in spite of the president's aggressive efforts at containment. We'll see more cases. We'll see some forms of community spreading.\xa0 But the risk to any individual American remains low. Thanks to the efforts the president's taken, they stay low. We're working to keep it that way. But things can change rapidly. But they should know, we have the best public health system in the world though looking out for them.\xa0 WALLACE: Let's talk about some of the new measures the president is considering. He announced a travel advisory yesterday to South Korea -- parts of South Korea and Italy. "", 'What would it take to go to a travel ban? And how seriously is he considering shutting down our southern border with Mexico?\xa0 AZAR: Well, right now Mexico has very few cases. So that would -- that would take a real change in the epidemiological profile and the risk to the United States from there. ', ""I think what he was trying to say is, all things are on the table. We're not going to take anything off the table in our armamentarium of tools we have to protect the American people.\xa0 So what he announced yesterday is -- we already had level three travel warnings for all of Italy and all of South Korea. That means essential travel only is recommended. But for the impacted areas in northern Italy and the one region of South Korea, we escalated that from the State Department to a level four advisory, which says do not go to these parts of Italy and to South Korea. \xa0WALLACE: And is there a point at which you could go to a travel ban? \xa0AZAR: We could look at using 212F, which is the procedure we've used for China, where we actually restrict entry from certain countries. The -- the point is with Italy and South Korea we have highly developed public health and health care systems. We have transparent leadership and very aggressive action that's been on it from day one. So, at this point, we think advising people not to go is the right measure, but everything will always be on the table. \xa0WALLACE: What about -- there's talk of invoking war powers to require U.S. companies to manufacture some goods in the national interest. One possibly -- I know you have millions of them, but one is that you might actually require companies to manufacture more protective masks. "", ""AZAR: That's right. So that's called the Defense Production Act. I believe it came into existence during the Korean War. It's actually used fairly commonly for Defense Department procurements here in the United States. Effectively, we can determine that our production should get to the front of the line. And so we go before any other contract so that they might have -- \xa0WALLACE: So -- so where are you on doing that? \xa0AZAR: So right now we are initiating the procurement processes for personal protective equipment, so that would be masks, as well as gowns, gloves, et cetera. We are -- we've got that process initiated. We're gathering information from potential vendors. "", ""WALLACE: But is that going to be under the War Powers Act that you're going to -- \xa0AZAR: If we need to. We'll -- we'll use it if we need to, but we, obviously, if we can work cooperatively with any vendor, we'd rather do that. "", ""But we're waiting for the emergency supplemental funding from Congress because, of course, we need that money to fully fund those procurements. \xa0WALLACE: One concern that -- that some Americans have is that President Trump and some of his advisors are low balling the risk from the coronavirus for political purposes. "", ""Here's one example. \xa0(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) \xa0DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Looks like by April, you know, in theory, when it gets a little warmer, it miraculously goes away. Oh, that's true. "", ""DR. ROBERT REDFIELD, DIRECTOR, CDC: I think this virus is probably with us beyond this season or beyond -- beyond this yet and I think eventually the virus will find a foothold and we will get community based transmission. \xa0(END AUDIO CLIP) \xa0WALLACE: Do you know that the coronavirus is going to disappear in April when the weather gets warmer? \xa0AZAR: No, we don't know that. The normal coronavirus, the annual cold, and -- as well as flu and other respiratory illnesses, often do dissipate and go away in warmer seasons. The virus just doesn't survive well in the warmer climate, warmer atmosphere. But we do not know as to this novel coronavirus how it will interact. SARS, for instance, which was a novel coronavirus, did not dissipate in April. "", ""What the president's been saying is, we hope that it will be like the regular cold or regular flu and dissipate, but we do not know. \xa0WALLACE: But here's another example of what some people are calling low balling by the president. "", ""Take a look. \xa0(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) \xa0TRUMP: Because of all we've done, the risk to the American people remains very low. \xa0DR. NANCY MESSONNIER, CDC: It's not so much a question of if this will happen anymore, but rather more of a question of exactly when this will happen and how many people in this country will have severe illness. \xa0(END AUDIO CLIP) \xa0WALLACE: Well, since Dr. Messonnier spoke, we have begun to see community transmission. We have seen severe illnesses. We have seen at least one death. "", ""Can you understand the concern about mixed messages coming from the administration? \xa0AZAR: I could understand the concern, but I hope people will understand what we're trying to do. We're trying to level with the American people at all times. So Dr. Messonnier was very clear with accurate information. The risk is low. It remains low. But we have always expected we'd see -- we would see more transmission. And as she predicted, we will see at least some limited community transmission. \xa0The president, though, is also trying to keep balance in messaging so that the American people don't engage in unwarranted panic. For instance, people running out and buying face masks. That's not needed. That's indicated. We don't recommend it. It actually can be harmful to individuals in an infection situation. "", ""So he's trying to keep good balance, I'm trying to keep good balance. But we're also trying to be radically transparent with our information to make sure folks know what might be coming so they can mentally prepare, as well as engage in normal prepared effectiveness.\xa0 WALLACE: I want to pick up on that with you because clearly part of public health is psychology. And in the last week we saw the Dow Jones go down 3,500 points. We see people buying masks, hoarding food and other supplies. Obviously part of this is a reasonable response to an unknown threat, but do you see some elements of panic?\xa0 AZAR: I see elements of uncertainty. I was with Secretary Mnuchin yesterday at our task force meeting at the White House and he was talking about the stock market reaction and how so much of the market is just dealing with uncertainty. And we're dealing with a novel virus. And so there is uncertainty. And I know that can make people feel uncomfortable. And that's why we are trying to give the American people all the information we have when we have it so they don't think there's secret information they're not getting. That at least helps -- we say what uncertainties we've got, and as we resolve them, we try to clarify. "", ""WALLACE: You just think (ph) people are overreacting?\xa0 AZAR: Yes, absolutely. If people are going out and buying face masks, that's not necessary. In fact, we need those masks for the people who should be using them, which are health care workers taking care of patients.\xa0 WALLACE: Finally, a whistleblower in your department raised a concern about a number, I think a dozen HHS workers who apparently said -- sent to receive the first evacuees from China, she says without proper gear, without proper training. And she raised this concern. "", ""I know you say you're investigating, but that woman, was she reassigned, as she claims, after she raised this concern?\xa0 AZAR: So, first, we -- it is vitally important that we protect our employees in any situation. It is vitally important that we follow the appropriate isolation or quarantine protocols in dealing with individuals. And it's important that no whistleblower ever be retaliated against. And we will never permit retaliation against the whistleblower.\xa0 Let me give you the facts that we know so far. First, every HHS employee who was involved in the allegations in the whistleblower's complaint has now been well over 14 days from any interaction with individuals and nobody is symptomatic or has the disease, so there was no risk -- there's no risk to the people of HHS, no risk to the community, even if the allegations prove to be true. So that's a very important fact.\xa0 \xa0We also have offered voluntary testing to our employees. It's not medically indicated because they don't have the virus -- "", 'WALLACE: OK. ', ""AZAR: But if it comforts them, we're going to get them tested so they know. "", ""WALLACE: And -- but what happened to the woman? Was she reassigned? You -- the -- she said -- has said more than 10 days ago that she was reassigned. You certainly know whether that happened.\xa0 AZAR: Well, I'm not going to discuss personnel matters. That wouldn't be proper for me to do. But there will be no retaliation against this individual or any other individual.\xa0 We are grateful -- if our employees raise concerns about our processes, if something proves not to be right, we are grateful for that. "", ""WALLACE: So if she was reassigned, I -- you can't -- I know you can't discuss it. If she was reassigned because of raising this complaint, you're saying she'll be restored to the position? "", ""AZAR: Nobody would ever be reassigned or discriminated against or prejudiced or retaliated against because of raising concerns about the functioning of the department.\xa0 WALLACE: And you can't tell me whether that happened. \xa0AZAR: I cannot -- I'm not going to tell you whether that happened because that's still under investigation. We are doing a comprehensive, thorough investigation.\xa0 WALLACE: Secretary Azar, thank you. Thanks for coming in today. And we'll, of course, be tracking your efforts and the efforts of the entire task force to follow and fight this disease in the week ahead.\xa0 AZAR: Thank you, Chris.\xa0 WALLACE: Up next, we ask our Sunday panel about the administration's response so far, and the political and economic fall-out.

', 'So much to get into. ', 'First to John Roberts of the White House on the quick fallout in events today -- John. ', 'JOHN ROBERTS, FOX NEWS CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: And good afternoon to you, Neil. ', ""Here at the White House, the big news today was when the president during our FOX News town hall that he would like to begin to reopen the economy by Easter Sunday. That'd be April 12. That'd be some 19 days from now. "", 'Getting some new information that bankers may think that that is a little bit too much of an accelerated schedule. ', 'But, earlier today, the president saying he thinks that he could get it done. Listen here. ', '(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ', ""DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I think it's absolutely possible. "", ""Now, people are going to have to practice all of the social distancing, and don't shake hands, and wash your hands, and all of the things that we are doing now. But we have to get our country back to work. "", '(END VIDEO CLIP) ', ""ROBERTS: President Trump saying that when people eventually do go back to work -- and we now don't know if it will be Easter Sunday -- it'll be sometime after -- that they will have to continue to practice what they have been practicing now, which is social distancing, increasing disinfection, handwashing, using hand sanitizer, that sort of thing. "", 'Now, President Trump and New York Governor Mario Cuomo -- sorry -- Andrew Cuomo -- I keep going to the father -- who is a Democrat, very much on the same page with this idea that you cannot keep the economy shuttered for a long time. ', ""President Trump very blunt, though, about the way that he said there's a trade-off here as to what you can and cannot do. Listen. "", '(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ', ""TRUMP: You're going to lose a number of people to the flu, but you're going to lose more people by putting a country into a massive recession or depression. You're going to lose people. You're going to have suicides by the thousands. "", '(END VIDEO CLIP) ', 'ROBERTS: Governor Cuomo said earlier today that no one is going to say accelerate the economy at the cost of human lives, but he said that there is a better way, that you could actually do two things at once. ', 'Listen to how he put it. ', '(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ', ""GOV. ANDREW CUOMO (D-NY): Job one has to be save lives. That has to be the priority. And there's a smarter approach to this. We don't have to choose between the two. "", 'You can develop a more refined public health strategy that is also an economic strategy. ', '(END VIDEO CLIP) ', ""ROBERTS: So, Neil, what both Governor Cuomo and the president are talking about is, now that we're into this, and we have learned a lot more, we know who is most vulnerable, and perhaps we can isolate those people, and perhaps we could isolate or contain clusters of outbreak of disease, and let mostly young people, or people who have tested to have had coronavirus and are now immune to it, through new serological tests, that may be available as early as next week, and slowly get things back to where they were prior to all of this. "", ""But it's looking like it may take a lot longer than Easter Sunday -- Neil. "", 'CAVUTO: All right, thank you, my friend very, very much. ', ""Let's go to Chad Pergram on Capitol Hill. "", ""Another source of optimism was the stimulus measure. That was a big reason why the Dow was up more than it's been since 1933. "", ""Let's go to Chad on what is propelling that talk -- Chad. "", ""CHAD PERGRAM, FOX NEWS CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, they're trying to finalize this deal, $2 trillion and change. "", ""We don't have an official price tag yet. But consider the raw size of that. The federal government spends $4.3 trillion every year. This would be north of $2 trillion. "", ""There's an old saying in Washington: Nothing is decided until after everything is decided. They are hopefully optimistic that they can have a vote tonight in the United States Senate, but they're not there yet. "", ""Here's the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell.

And if they get it through the Senate, then there's the House of Representatives. "", '(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ', ""REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): Hopefully, we can have unanimous consent and also recognition that there's some things that needs to be done for worker protection in these dangerous situations, for more family and medical leave, with issues that relate to food security. "", '(END VIDEO CLIP) ', 'PERGRAM: Now, you heard the speaker of the House refer to unanimous consent. What does that mean? ', ""It means that they don't actually have a roll call vote in the House chamber. There's a lot of concern among the current 430 members of the House about bringing everybody back to vote. "", ""What they would do is, they would ask if the bill should be passed, and so long as not a single member objects, they pass the bill. But it's unclear when they can get this through the Senate and then get it through the House. "", ""One thing I should note that's important, Neil, is that the temperature on Capitol Hill today is much lower than it was yesterday. That's usually a good sign that people are working together, they're working this out. There was a lot of fighting on the Senate floor yesterday, which was rather extraordinary. That's not happening today, which means that they're getting this in form. "", ""What's next? Well, Roy Blunt, the Republican senator from Missouri, indicated they're already starting to talk about phase four. Consider the size of this bill. It's ginormous. But there's a lot of things that they can't put into this piece of legislation. That's the phase three. They have to get to phase four sometime down the road, Neil. "", 'CAVUTO: All right, it gets more expensive as we go. Chad Pergram outside the United States Capitol. ', ""Now to the president's goal of trying to unwind all of this -- that is, all of the staying-at-home stuff and all the business stoppages that have caused and prompted a lot of follow-up from this. "", ""What does Dr. Christopher Ohl think of this? He's the Wake Forest Health infectious disease specialist. "", 'Doctor, to start on winding this as soon as Easter, less than three weeks away, what do you think of that? ', ""DR. CHRISTOPHER OHL, WAKE FOREST HEALTH INFECTIOUS DISEASE SPECIALIST: Well, I think we'd all want to see it unwinding by Easter, and we hope we can unwind it by Easter. "", ""But if you look at the curves of epidemics for this, COVID-19, and look at the curves from other countries, it basically describes a hill. And I think we got a lot more hill to go up yet. And whether we will be up and over the peak of that hill and can start relaxing by Easter might be a little bit ambitious. That's my personal opinion. "", ""Viruses sometimes don't respect... "", '(CROSSTALK) ', 'CAVUTO: The timing might be ambitious, but -- but -- right, I hear you. ', 'There is this possibility that you roll it in, younger people first returning to work, opening businesses that way. What do you think of that? Or should it be everyone together? ', ""OHL: I personally think it's probably in everyone together. "", 'Certainly, what we want to do is protect and form a protective cocoon around our vulnerable populations, the elderly and those with other diseases. ', ""But in order to do so, I think we're all going to have to pull some weight. I tell people in North Carolina, it's a little bit of like a hurricane coming ashore. They understand that. Whether it's a Category 5 or a Category 1, maybe we can make a bit of a difference by some social distancing and by some sheltering in place, that it doesn't have to be extreme. "", 'But a lot of it can be just common sense. When you think about getting groups of people together or things that really have a high risk of close contact, those are the things that we want to try to prevent. ', ""And maybe we could relax some other areas where the risk isn't so high. But I think we're all in it together for the protection... "", '(CROSSTALK) ', ""CAVUTO: I hear you, sir. I'm sorry. We're -- with this audio delay, it's my fault for jumping on you. "", ""But one of the things we're hearing right now, with some three new states added to the mix, more than half the American people are under some sort of stay-at-home requirement, order, law, and that could rise. "", ""And just today, we learned that India's prime minister is issuing a lockdown, not for some of his 1.3 billion people, all of them. "", ""I'm just wondering what you make of the effectiveness of these lockdown, stay-at-homes, whatever you want to call them? "", 'OHL: Yes. ', ""So, how much do we really know? Well, we haven't done anything like this on a nationwide scale since 1917 or 1918. So, there's still a lot to figure out. "", ""But we're looking at information from some areas in Asia and some other areas now in some parts of Europe, where it maybe has been effective. "", ""So, right now, the whole thing of find every case and do contact tracing and stamping out, we're too far along for that in most places now. So, I think we have to do what best science and what best epidemiology tells us might work. "", ""And that's the social distancing or a modified shelter in place. "", 'CAVUTO: Got it, Doctor. Thank you, but more so for always being on the front lines, getting very little sleep, and I imagine now and then very little thanks. ', 'But I think this country thanks for all your hard work. Thank you, sir. Be well. ', 'OHL: Yes, thanks, Neil. Good to be here. ', 'CAVUTO: Same here. ', ""All right, let's go to Susan Li on the enormous rally today, a big comeback here, better than 2,100 points, and a lot of it, I would assume, on this optimism about this stimulus, costly as it is, maybe because it's so costly. "", 'SUSAN LI, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Yes. ', 'CAVUTO: What do you think? ', ""LI: Yes, well, it's going to cost a lot of money, but biggest points rally in the Dow's history. So that lifted all three benchmarks off these three- year lows. "", 'And, as you mentioned, we heard from Senator Chuck Schumer that says we are on the two-yard line in passing this $2 trillion stimulus package. Couple that with $4 trillion in Federal Reserve firepower yesterday, and the markets were off and running today. ', ""Also, you can't discount the words coming from President Trump. He is now targeting Easter for the reopening of the economy. Might be optimistic, but the fact that he wants to reopen the U.S. economy sooner, rather than later, that helped lift sentiment today. "", ""So, sectors that did well, along with the U.S. economic growth, did well in the sessions, so we're talking about the energy sector, the materials and financials, also big tech. I should remind our viewers, analysts think that big tech might emerge out of the coronavirus pandemic even stronger than before. "", ""For instance, Amazon can't keep up with its deliveries and orders. Also, Zoom Video has doubled so far on the year. Netflix saw record streaming traffic just this past weekend. And Apple says they will reopen stores in the first half of April. "", ""Now, we also just got the latest economists' forecast for jobless claims, which are due out on Thursday. Economists think that one million Americans filed for unemployment benefits in the week, which would be nearly two times the record we saw back in 1982, when 695,000 Americans applied for jobless benefits. "", ""But that's actually smaller than what Goldman Sachs is predicting, Neil. They're looking for 2.25 million Americans to file for unemployment benefits. Bank of America says three million. These are pretty dire numbers. "", 'CAVUTO: Staggering numbers. ', 'Susan Li, thank you very, very much. ', ""Well, it's become sort of like the regular trend among states, right? Go ahead and enforce these stay-at-home policies, but not all states, not in South Dakota. "", 'In fact, we will talk to the governor there, why she decided, so far, not yet. ', ""(COMMERCIAL BREAK) \xa0CAVUTO: All right, welcome back, everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto. "", ""And we're monitoring the entire situation where people are staying at home. More than half the people in this country are doing just that, but not everybody, and sometimes for state constitutional reasons. "", 'This seems to be the case in South Dakota. ', 'The Republican governor there, Kristi Noem, with us right now. ', 'Governor, thank you for taking the time. ', 'What is in effect in your state, Governor, just to clarify things? ', ""GOV. KRISTI NOEM (R-SD): Well, I told the people of South Dakota that, if we work together, that we can bend the curve, that we can slow down this virus in our state, and really make sure that we're taking care of people. "", ""So we know that we're in a good situation today. It's going to get much more difficult in the coming weeks, but ever -- whatever plan we pursue, we're going to have to sustain. And we're going to have to do it for not just a week or two. We're going to have to do it for months. "", 'And I wanted one that we could be successful at. ', 'CAVUTO: So, explain how it differs from some of these other mandatory stay- at-home programs that some of your fellow governors have instituted. ', 'NOEM: Well, we have based every single decision on facts and science. ', ""So, I told the people of South Dakota we were going to follow the social distancing protocols. We are going to practice good hygiene, if they don't feel well, they will stay home and call their doctor, and that we're also not going to mandate that businesses close, but we're going to tell them to innovate, to figure out new ways to take care of their customers, and to make sure that they're protecting families in the process. "", ""What I love about South Dakota is that they all get personal responsibility. They know that they're personally responsible for their own health, for their family and their communities. "", ""And they're really getting on board with making sure that we're doing the right things here in South Dakota. And that just makes me incredibly proud of our state. "", ""CAVUTO: Well, even the president's task force on this doesn't like the idea of crowds larger than 10 being in a single area. "", 'NOEM: Mm-hmm. ', ""CAVUTO: A lot of the restaurants, I'm sure, in your state have capacity for more than that. If they have more than 10 people, is that a risky thing? Should they know better? What? "", 'NOEM: I have told them not to do that. ', 'I have told them the guidelines and the baseline that I want them to follow. And then, in my communications with all the mayors and city councils and county commissioners, I have told them that, if they want to go farther, they can, but that they need to be communicating with these business owners. ', ""If they see a bad actor out there, someone who's not following the recommendations of the CDC that we know are fact -- factual to control this virus, then they need to go have face-to-face conversations with these business owners, and tell them that they need to be changing practices to protect people. "", ""That's been working in so many communities. And we have done a good job now of slowing down the infection rate in our state. I know it'll increase. I know it will be something that will continue to be -- get more and more difficult as days go on.

We all know 1,991 delegates needed to win.

Sanders wants everyone to have the same insurance plan provided by the government. Private insurance plans under his Medicare for all would be prohibited.

', '(CROSSTALK) ', 'TORRANCE: I know, I keep -- sorry, trillion -- half of which, $1.7 trillion, he would put towards a Green New Deal. ', ""And this isn't just money, of course, where we have got to raise these taxes, but it's also some of his ideas would kill jobs. Joe Biden is not as bad on, say, fracking as Bernie Sanders, but I think he is going to be pushed by his party to get tougher, and that would mean killing jobs in places like Pennsylvania. "", ""So, yes, the idea is, he's not as crazy as Bernie Sanders, but it's not just about Joe Biden. It's also about where his party is pushing him. I mean, keep in mind, Bernie Sanders pushed Hillary Clinton to the left in 2016. And the party really has stayed there ever since.

The strict social distancing guidelines are an attempt to flatten the curve, an approach that has been described as America’s best bet at drawing the coronavirus outbreak under our control.', 'While it is true that flattening the curve is an important tactic, it may not be sufficient to end the epidemic quickly. In principle, “flattening the curve” slows the rate of new infections, but the total number of infections under the curve may remain the same. Our goal should be to reduce the total number of people exposed and infected, not just slow down the spread of the disease.', 'There may be an important benefit to flattening the curve, even if the total number of infections remains the same.

The most likely scenario we face today with the lockdown measures we’ve introduced is a successive series of reinfections over a prolonged period of time.', 'Think of it in terms of waves, with a surge in the outbreak like what we see today ebbing when the impact of social distancing measures takes effect, only to surge again when lockdowns are lifted and infections in other parts of the country reignite the spread of the virus in areas that\xa0once had their outbreak under control.', 'The effect of this prolongation on businesses, the economy\xa0and for each of us as individuals remains obscure. Will any one of us feel comfortable re-entering normal life when we know the next wave of infection lurks just around the corner?', 'Singapore for example, a country that acted early and seemed to have brought its epidemic under control, is now shutting down, shifting most businesses and schools online. Cases in the country have doubled in the past 10\xa0days, in part due to citizens returning home with new infections carried back from abroad. Their experience is a bellwether of what may await us here.', 'To end the epidemic, we must not focus solely on flattening the curve but completely extinguishing it.

"", 'And, by the way, that is one thing that has been happening, one of the reasons why, as Bill pointed out, Wall Street was up today, seeing some clarity on this, and maybe America getting back to work, if in stages or not.

They have two different views on this, but they do seem to be on the same page eventually getting us all back to what was before, as if we can go back to what was before. "", ""Welcome, everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto, and this is YOUR WORLD. "", ""Let's go to Hillary Vaughn at the White House right now, because a busy day still in store for the president.

', ""But just because the government may decide to lift restrictions on the national level, it doesn't mean the economy will reboot right away, Neil, because a new Gallup poll found that 71 percent of people say that even if the government does lift these restrictions, they're still going to wait to resume their life back to normal -- Neil.

Over the next week, peaks are forecast for an additional nine states.

The model shows an additional 14 states peaking between April 22 and the 30th. ', ""And in the first half of May, nine states are forecast to reach their peak hospital usage. To prepare for the surge, states are building temporary hospitals. Here in Atlanta, they're setting up a 200-bed unit at the Georgia World Congress Center, a major convention facility. "", ""The beds can be doubled to 400, if need be. But once states reach their peaks, wide-scale testing will be needed to isolate infected individuals and trace their contacts, so America can go back to a containment strategy, rather than mitigation, which is what we're doing right now.

He also said mass gatherings even late summer, MLB, NFL, college football, in his words, not going to happen. "", ""Each governor has their own benchmarks to guide decision-making. Governor Newsom said California needs to, number one, expand testing, tracing and tracking to identify new infections and suppress hot spots, so they don't bleed into other states or communities. "", 'Secondly, having the infrastructure to isolate and quarantine infected people, and finally protect vulnerable populations, elderly, homeless. Finally, the health care system needs to be robust, should the virus reemerge. Both governors say that their decision will be based on science, but recognize the economic balance.

But we also extend a recognition in that light that this can't be a permanent state.

', 'We have with us right now Dr. Qanta Ahmed, a pulmonologist over at the Langone Medical Center in New York. ', 'Doctor, great to have you. ', 'What would you look for, Doctor, to sort of unwind this or justify unwinding this? ', 'DR. QANTA AHMED, PULMONOLOGIST: I mean, great to be with you, Neil. ', ""Everything that's been said makes common sense. But I think what we're talking about as a nation is that we had a hard stop, we came to a grinding halt abruptly, and now we're looking to softly restart the economy. That's what we have to do. "", ""And that is what we should do in a peri-pandemic, or, let's hope, soon a post-pandemic period. Remember, this pandemic that's arrived like a tsunami to New York isn't just going to be the only wave. Pandemics have a habit of coming in successive waves, localized outbreaks.\xa0 And we now know how to handle them. We have learned a great deal in New York at NYU Langone. We are ready. We know how to treat them. We have the resources, and we can surge capacity. All of that is great. "", ""But at the same time, I also want to hear from business leaders on a global level. And I'm so thankful our president is a businessman. For instance, Fred Smith, the CEO of FedEx, and how they resumed services in China. Today's Financial Times, the CEO of Volvo talked about how they have resumed work at Volvo in China and will be opening in South Carolina in May 6. "", 'So what they do is, every employee gets their temperature checked. Every employee has PPE. The cafeteria is now serving only a certain number of employees. ', ""All work forces in the U.S. are going to have to think about working around the clock, so that you can reduce office density by 60 percent. You have 30 percent of your work force working on three different shifts. We're going to have to make so many changes. And we can do it quickly. And we can reignite this economy. "", ""CAVUTO: I don't know what is more impressive, Doctor, that you're all over this whole pulmonology and medical stuff, but you would make a darn good financial anchor with those references to -- about business developments. "", 'Touche to you. ', '(LAUGHTER) ', 'CAVUTO: As a pulmonologist, Doctor -- and you really look at respiratory tract, that sort of thing. ', 'They are -- those with problems in that area tend to be the most vulnerable or among the vulnerable. Would you recommend that that group, that subset of the population -- there are others, those with diabetes, et cetera -- who would not be in that first wave of workers returning? ', ""AHMED: Super question. And what you're referring to, I would absolutely support, because, in my critically ill patients, many of them have preexisting conditions that you're mentioning. "", 'But I think the number one risk factor the United States is facing is our extraordinarily high levels of obesity. The obese patients are becoming more critically ill. We have seen that in 1957, in 1968, in 2000. And in this time, pandemic viral pandemics are more dangerous for the obese person. ', ""So we have to identify populations that are more at risk. Some of that geographic, from what we know from Dr. Fauci and Dr. Birx. And some of that, for instance, New Orleans has twice the death rate as New York right now. And partly that's the underlying conditions and the obesity. "", ""But also, in -- within employers, we are not going to discriminate against people. We're not going to shame people that are dealing with obesity, but we must protect them more aggressively and provide them better access to all of the technology we're gaining. "", ""And partly why I want to see our economy revived is because I am seeing the enormous suffering of the families and the patients that are dealing with this illness. And we're not really mentioning the economic impact on American health care. "", 'New York Presbyterian is $1 billion in the hole last month. Health care workers are out of work and health care workers are in need of hazard pay that are on the front lines. So, our whole country needs to get moving. The president has shown pretty good instincts in this pandemic. ', ""One of them is, we can't stay frozen forever. We are going to reopen. And we're going to do it in a tailored fashion, based on demographics, based on risk factors, and based on epidemiology. And we can do this. "", 'CAVUTO: Dr. Ahmed, very good catching up with you. Thank you very much. A lot of good ideas there. ', ""To the doctor's point, it could be soon. It could be a little sooner than thought. And this breakdown wouldn't be all at once. But this de-lockdown phase is one of the things that the financial markets are looking for. "", 'We had a heady advance in the Dow Jones industrials today, better than 550 points.

Morgan Chase, not surprisingly, they had warned it would be awful, and it was, but even in some of those cases, investors rewarded them, because it wasn't as awful as they thought, and they think there will be a short shelf life on all of this.

', ""Doctor, what do you make of this technology? I know there are a lot of personal privacy advocates who have issues with it. But looking, if I can, at just the medical benefits of that, or the heads up that people will have about who is contacting whom, who's out there, what do you make of it?\xa0 \xa0DR. SANDRO GALEA, DEAN, BOSTON UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH: Well, first of all, this is nothing new. "", ""We do contact tracing all the time. Right now, if there's an outbreak of measles, tuberculosis or sexually transmitted disease, including HIV, we do contact tracing. And, essentially, the principle is very simple, is that you identify people who are infected early, and then you find out who they have been in contact with, so that you can test them as well. "", ""And the idea is that you contain the disease. So it is not a new concept. I mean, it's a concept that has been around for hundreds of years. And in many respects, it is what we should have done right from the beginning of the COVID epidemic. "", ""The fact that we didn't do it really is a reflection of the fact that we were unprepared. "", '(CROSSTALK) ', 'CAVUTO: All right. ', 'So, how do we keep track of those contacts? What kind of technology are we using? I know, in the case of the high-tech cases like Google, what have you, how are we monitoring that? ', ""GALEA: Well, at a very simple level, you don't need fancy technology. At a simple level, you need a phone to call the people who are infected, find out who their contacts are, and you can document them on a spreadsheet. "", ""Now, you can get fancy. You can have apps that document that. You can have apps that talk to each other. My phone can talk to your phone if we have been close to each other, which means that, if I have COVID, you would know that you're at risk of COVID. "", 'But the technology is in service of the fundamental issue. The fundamental issue is, we identify people with infection early, we identify their contacts, so we can test them and isolate them to keep disease from spreading. ', 'CAVUTO: Do you see this under control, Doctor, from your vantage point, or more under control? What are some of your worries? ', ""GALEA: Well, I think we are -- we're probably cresting the epidemic nationally, as you said earlier in your program. "", ""I think it's going to take us another couple of months. And we are going to get to a place where we have a chance almost as a do-over, where we're going to have the epidemic down to manageable levels, and then run the risk of having any recurrence or having other spikes, as have happened in other places. "", ""So this is our moment. This is our moment to implement contact tracing, where we can find cases quickly to contain it, so, if there are cases of infection, they do not become an outbreak, the outbreak doesn't become an epidemic again, and the epidemic doesn't result again in us having to close down economies and close down the country. "", 'But to do that, we need to have testing. We need to identify cases quickly. We need to contact trace, find people who are at risk, isolate and test those people. And contact tracing is at the heart of all of that. ', 'CAVUTO: Do you have any worries about beginning this unwinding process, Doctor, May 1? ', 'GALEA: Yes and no. ', 'I mean, yes, I do. I suppose the operative question is, what you mean by the unwinding? Unwinding has been interpreted in some of the public conversations as being we undo everything, everybody goes back to normal. And that obviously is not the right solution. ', ""And -- or unwinding can be, let's take it a step at a time, see where we're at in the epidemic, and slowly start reintroducing contact, while being measured, judicious and making sure that we are monitoring cases and have the testing and the capacity to monitor if cases spread. "", ""If that's what we mean by unwinding, then I think it's reasonable to start slowly asking ourselves, how do we slowly reintroduce normal day-to-day life? If by unwinding, we mean changing everything overnight, that's not the right idea. "", 'CAVUTO: All right, Doctor, thank you very, very much. We will watch it very, very closely.

', ""But he didn't mention Trump by name. And, instead, he really, at the end of his endorsement video, was talking about how -- endorsing some of the same things that Bernie Sanders was doing, how we need real structural change, and that Joe Biden's platform is the most progressive that we have had from any Democratic nominee in history, and that he needs -- there needs to be a public option to take Obamacare one step further, as well as a bold Green New Deal, and things like $15 federal minimum wage.

Kate Brown and Washington Gov. Jay Inslee\xa0– announced an agreement for reopening their states’ economies and controlling COVID-19 into the future.', 'The governors said health outcomes and science, not politics, would drive decision-making. Any modifications to each state’s stay-at-home order will be grounded in a comprehensive understanding of the health impacts of COVID-19, they added, saying no large-scale reopening will take place until metrics reflected a significant decline in the spread of the virus.', 'A number of states in the Northeast – including New York, which has been the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S. – announced a similar plan on Monday.

The problem is we don't have a control Earth. "", ""We can't do a side-by-side comparison of what our actions are if we hadn't have done them.

"", ""To realize that there is going to be a risk that you can mitigate it but you can't eliminate it. You got to look at the disease and death reduction over time, the possibility that it might come back. You need to do random testing.

Just like my family and our small business that has been really gutted by this. And so speaking a little bit more on that payroll protection program, there's no way that the small businesses, these families, as you pointed out, will be able to meet the payroll forgiveness threshold if social distancing mandates remain after their doors are opened, just like you've said. "", ""Because there will be no revenue revival, and why should the federal government be stipulating how many full-time employees they restore when their revenue streams are being annihilated. And this is what's important for viewers, too, that most of the funds that get paid back via loans are amortized over just 18 months or two years. "", ""So how is an aggressive repayment plan like that sustainable during quarantine, let alone afterward during a period of hopefully growth? And if growth is hindered, that means job creation is hindered. And these industries that you guys mentioned, like, restaurants, Jesse, and hospitality, they've already seen millions of workers laid off. "", ""So what we need in part, like Greg was mentioning specifics, you know, to have allowable funds to include cost of goods for inventory purchased on 30-day terms before foreseeable closures. There are food vendors right now that are sitting on billions of dollars worth of inventory. And like you said, numbers, well, that's good food. That is good food that is being wasted. "", ""Dairy farmers are dumping milk. Farmers are seeing their crops rot. Restaurants can't donate their perishables because of red tape, or they can't afford the labor to deliver it. And the final insult to injury -- I will close with this, is that the government right, just now in terms of regulations and how we think about the future and as Greg, said sort of creating plans or the larger picture of preventing this in the future or addressing it. "", ""Is that, for example, those dairy farmers that are dumping thousands of gallons of milk, they need permits to do so. And OSHA, in its infinite wisdom right now, has been paying surprise visits to these skeleton crews in the hospitality industry to make sure that they comply with regulations. That's not what small businesses need. That's not what families need. They need action. "", ""WATTERS: Yeah. You have to cut back on the regulatory crackdown at a time like this.

"", ""But what's even more moronic -- it's not even an Acosta original. He stole that from that the hack buffet, known as -- that dopey duo, Morning Joe. So I think we should start doing contact tracing on really dumb ideas in the media. You know, identifying someone who's been near somebody who has been infected by a dumb idea and then try to trace it back. "", 'So it starts at MSNBC, and then the virus moves to CNN, and then moves back to MSNBC. It keeps going around. And if we could stop it, we could prevent more infections. But one last point. If this pandemic is far less than what we predicted, it is going to create a swirl of un-provable arguments. So we might as well just get used to it. ', ""We're going to have one side saying it's all social distancing. Another one saying that fear was oversold. The projections were ridiculous. People will say that Trump saved lives by shutting down travel. Others will say he put the economy before people. These things are going to go on for the rest of your life. You don't want to get sucked into it because they are almost all un-provable. "", ""COMPAGNO: Dana, I wanted to play a video for you and get your thoughts on it. This is what James Carville had to say -- what Republicans will do to stay in power. Take a look and then we'll get your thoughts.

Just the extent they would go to hold onto power. It was all about one Supreme Court seat in Wisconsin. They will kill people to stay in power, literally. "", '(END VIDEO CLIP) ', ""PERINO: So you wanted me to react to that. So OK, the Wisconsin thing, I think that clearly there is a lot of criticism that could be thrown that way. I don't know -- why they couldn't have worked it out. I know there was blame to be had on both sides. The Republicans and the legislature, the governor being a Democrat, slow to move. They couldn't work together. "", ""I do think the most ridiculous thing was you had the Speaker of the House - - the leadership of the state legislature, a Republican, in full-on protective gear with a mask doing an interview, telling everybody in Wisconsin that it was perfectly safe to go outside and vote. That I think opened them up to a lot of criticism. And it's not too early to start thinking about what to do in the future. "", ""There are criticisms about mail-in voting, though you have a state like Utah. It's all-mail in. They don't seem to have a problem. Nobody questions it. We can have that debate. And this issue of voter suppression, the Democrats are going to talk about that a lot between now and November. And I think the Republicans have to have a much better answer as to how they are going to try to deal with it, so all of those things are happening. "", 'If I could say one thing about the question that Acosta posed to the president about the funding, it reminded me of -- for eight years, the media would go after Dick Cheney over and over again for investments in Halliburton. He had no investments in Halliburton when he was the vice president. He would not be able to benefit. ', ""And it didn't matter how many times you explain this to them in a very logical way. The media just didn't care. They just continue to try to pummel somebody. But I think if I could be use a sports analogy, this one at $450, if that's the investment, that's what would you call a swing and a miss. "", ""COMPAGNO: Jesse, ABC published a damaging report on President Trump's reaction to this. And then a military official refuted it and they refused to issue a correction. Will we ever see some type of acknowledgment of the responsibility that they've had in shaping that narrative? "", ""WATTERS: Probably not. You didn't see it with Russia. I don't know why you wouldn't see it with this. I mean, if we had today's media during World War II, they would blame FDR for Pearl Harbor instead of the Japanese. They would probably blame the House Republicans at the time. But you see my point. This is China's deal. China lied. The WHO botched this. "", ""The virus, Mother Earth is killing people, not the president. I mean, there's still so much we don't know about this virus. This is an invisible enemy. We shutdown the entire U.S. economy, that wasn't aggressive enough? I mean, they criticize the president for acting too late or not listening to the scientists. Show me in February where Dr. Birx and Fauci said we need to all shelter in place. You can't find it because it didn't happen.

If you can find that person, I will buy them a round of drinks. But it didn't happen. They were obsessed with Mike Bloomberg at this time. And to Greg's point, you can play with these models and projections however way you want. "", 'You could say Trump saved lives. You could say mitigation works. You could say the models were wrong or the models were updated when new information was put into it. Look at the climate change models. All of them have been wrong. Yet, people are obsessed with the climate change models. I mean, I could play this game all day. ', ""I could say Barack Obama did nothing while the opioid epidemic cost 200,000 American lives, and that's on him. I could say that, but I won't, because I'm a very classy guy.

', ""WILLIAMS: Well, let me just -- Emily, let me just go back to this business about what happened in Wisconsin. You know, I just thought that was a huge flaw. I think it was an embarrassment for us as an American people. I don't think people should have to choose between staying healthy and, you know, participating in an election. "", ""I thought it was wrong. And, you know, even when there were questions about mail-in voting to the president yesterday, the president said, oh, no. It's terrible. You could see it all in front. And then they said, Mr. President, you voted by mail in the last election in Florida. He said yeah, that's true. I mean, to me, it's just, again, about voter suppression. "", ""So we will come back to that topic. As to the media, well, I think a lot of what we're hearing their, to me, I would put it in the category, Emily, of not helping us to move forward, not, you know, not helping us to progress and get out of this situation. This thing is so serious. I would rather not get hooked up in those kind of trivial finger-pointing, backbiting, backstabbing. "", ""I will say that a non-partisan basis, the fact is that we as a country were slow to respond is specific. The president when he was downplaying the seriousness of it, I think the administration was slow to respond. But let's leave it there. And let's now try to pick up pace and do the things that are necessary to get us in the right place.

We will play that tape for you next. ', '(COMMERCIAL BREAK) ', ""WILLIAMS: Welcome back. We continue to monitor the start of the White House Coronavirus task force briefing. But let's turn to some 2020 politics first. Now that Joe Biden has become the presumptive Democrat nominee, President Trump is mocking the former VP for not yet picking up a key endorsement. Take a look. "", '(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ', ""TRUMP: I don't know why President Obama hasn't supported Joe Biden a long time ago. There's something he feels is wrong. He will come out. I'm sure he's got to come out at some point, because he certainly doesn't want to see me for four more years. It does amaze me that President Obama hasn't supported Sleepy Joe. It just hasn't happened. "", ""When is it going to happen? When is it going to happen? He knows something that you don't know. But I think I know. But you don't know, so it will be interesting. "", '(END VIDEO CLIP) ', ""WILLIAMS: And speaking of President Obama, Democrats are reportedly salivating for the former president to come off the sidelines to take on President Trump. Greg, I wanted to go to you and say it's the -- is President Trump just the lighting and sowing disarray and, you know, this unity among Democrats at this moment? "", ""GREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS HOST: It's weird, you know, I hadn't seen that clip. It is -- it is kind of amazing how real Trump can be, and how like almost street level, that kind of commentary is, and that everybody knows what he's talking about. And he says, it's so clearly. Obama reminds me of when I've committed to do some kind of function that I want to get out of. "", ""He's like, get the bachelor finale, right? And he's, he's faced with his final rose, and it's supposed to be that person and he doesn't know how we got there, and he's beginning to think I need to get away. So, the bad news is Obama hasn't endorsed Joe Biden. The good news is Joe Biden has endorsed Obama. "", ""WILLIAMS: Emily, but isn't -- I mean, does it matter when he does it? I don't think there's any question that he's going to endorse Joe Biden. "", ""EMILY COMPAGNO, FOX NEWS HOST: I think it does matter, Juan. And here's why I totally loved your intro song to this block. Do you remember Eddie and the Cruisers which that song was in that soundtrack? When Wordman is sitting at the computer or sitting at the at the piano, and he was teaching Eddie about this stanza, remember? And it was basically that after a pause, what follows holds more weight. "", ""And I think I assume that's what is happening with the Obama endorsement. Of course, it's inevitable, but it's probably going to happen around the convention post Coronavirus, when Democrats who are totally thirsty and ready for that messianic moment will lap it up and then it'll dominate all the airwaves. "", ""And I think Joe Biden obviously what he has in front of him though, his two biggest challenges while uniting the party, but we've already seen him sort of capitulate to Bernie and Elizabeth Warren in that, but it's (AUDIO GAP) and then how to attack the president post (AUDIO GAP). "", ""WILLIAMS: OK, Emily, we're having a few technical problems with that. Let me -- let me ask Dana to pop in here. Dana, Emily was making the point that right now Coronavirus dominates everything. Don't you think it would be smart to save a big endorsement for when it could dominate the news, that would be Obama endorsing Biden? "", ""DANA PERINO, FOX NEWS HOST: Well, I think President Trump is probably the number one politician that's ever understood mass media in the -- in the moment, and he knows how to dominate it, and he's done super well. The second best is President Obama and his team. So I think that if they were to do it now, it would just get buried and it would be fizzled. And then that big punch that they would get out of it would just go away. "", ""I don't know if it'll happen around the convention, I would imagine so. But also, we already know that President Obama has been working the phones behind the scenes. He was on the phone with Bernie Sanders, in fact, right before he dropped out. "", ""I do want to say one thing about Joe Biden. He announced a couple of things today that might have -- people might have missed. He has gone Bernie Sanders way on a couple of things. He announced two policy proposals today, and I'm sorry, I'm looking down at my phone just to tell you. He said he would lower the Medicare age to 60, which would blow up that program even faster. "", ""That's not Medicare for all, but it's still not going in the right direction with longer lifespans, and people healthy and able to work. And the second thing he said is he would do a huge, massive amount of student loan debt. Now, let me qualify that by saying low and middle-income borrowers, but again, it just shows how far Bernie Sanders was able to pull Joe Biden to the left. "", ""WILLIAMS: So Jesse, picking up on Dana's point, you see the president trying to separate the Bernie Bros from Joe Biden and saying, hey, come over here. That's what he was tweeting yesterday. And now you see him today in all of these comments saying, oh, Obama didn't endorse and you know, we don't know about whether or not Bernie is really on the train with Joe Biden. Do you see this as just politics? I mean, Greg said he saw it as just brutal direct politics. "", ""JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS HOST: I used to pull those kinds of stunts in high school. I used to go up to a friend of mine at the lunch table and said, you know, what, Andy's been talking a lot of trash. And then I go to John, and I'd say, hey, John, you know, Andy's talking trash about you. And then later in the lunchroom, they'd fight and I just sit back and watch the brawl. "", ""But that's what Trump does. He just kind of like makes people go after each other. About the endorsement, you don't endorse during a pandemic, so he's got to wait. But every day he waits gives the president an opportunity to just kind of stoke that fire. "", ""In an ideal world, they do some big announcement in a swing state in front of a huge crowd this summer. But that -- I don't know if that's possible during this time of social mitigation. So you don't know when it's going to be, but if they try to produce something on television, it's just going to look stilted. "", ""But the bottom line is, Barack Obama knows that Joe can't cut it. He doesn't have what it takes. He never did, never will. And if you read any book about the Obama administration, everybody says the same thing. "", ""WILLIAMS: All right, the daily White House Coronavirus Task Force briefing, it's coming up. But directly ahead, President Trump weighing in on the insane documentary Tiger King, yes, Tiger King, so stay tuned. That's next on THE FIVE. "", '(COMMERCIAL BREAK) ', ""GUTFELD: The White House Coronavirus Task Force is about to come out and give another briefing. While we wait for that, let's do this.

You can ask whatever the president whatever you want to ask. I mean, that's the chair. You're the -- you're in the press. But I did think, as you say, this is an important serious issue in the country, the pandemic, and I think we should be focused on that. "", ""I will say that's -- I've been watching that show, Tiger King -- and man you got, you know, gay polygamy, you got animal abuse, you got -- it's unbelievable, murder for hire plots.

After eight, I'm exhausted. I go to bed. I like the sound of these things that murder for hire. I'm check. I'm into that. Polygamy, check. Dirtbags, check. I mean, this is right up my alley. I just haven't had time for it with everything is going on.

Emily couldn't this question may have been like a be a signal that maybe things might be getting better. So you could have a little bit of levity because it feels like we're getting some -- we're seeing the light at the end of this tunnel. "", 'WATTERS: Yes. ', ""COMPAGNO: I think that's a good way of looking at it, Greg. "", 'GUTFELD: Thank you. ', ""COMPAGNO: But I will say what's so funny to me is unlike the entire country, I've never watched Tiger King and I never even saw a trailer for it. So in my head, I concocted that it was about this guy who like had all these, you know, rescue tigers and did cool stuff in this kind of big, like farm refuge area. So when Juan was listing the stuff that this is about, I'm like, Oh, my God. I mean -- and then when I heard about the question with President Trump, and that he's been, you know, incarcerated. So the whole thing to me now, my daydream has been shattered. "", 'GUTFELD: Dana, so I put it to you. Should President Trump pardon Tiger King and make him the head of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service? ', ""PERINO: That is an excellent question. I think we'll have to wait until after the election to see if that could actually pass muster. One thing about that question is that kind of showed that the President is just like us, right? So maybe he hasn't watched it, he hasn't heard about it. "", ""But, you know, we are dealing with a very serious time. If I was in the room, I wouldn't have asked the question, but I do think that was pretty funny that the President, the way he handled it, and it just gave a moment of levity for the country. That's not a bad thing. That's actually good. But I would also say that show is so boring and stupid. And I watched one episode, and not watching anymore. "", ""GUTFELD: Wow. That's what Elaine has said too. She didn't like it either. And I'm like -- and so then I was interested in all that polygamy, and she was like, not having it, Greg. So anyway, could the pandemic be the end of the handshake? I hope so. Hear what Dr. Fauci said about that next.

You get a measure of a man that way, then you can maybe grab them by the shoulder or the bicep and do that. I like that. I'm a politician like that. Someone like Greg that freaks them out. Greg is looking forward to this new non-handshake world. He doesn't like to be touched. He doesn't like to have to extend his arm. This is just going to create a lot of awkward moments though.

Information is our chief weapon against the coronavirus, so every night we open our show by trying to give you more of it. Chief breaking news correspondent, Trace Gallagher joins us now with a look at the very latest numbers. Hey, Trace. ', 'TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CHIEF BREAKING NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Tucker, if you look at the New York coronavirus numbers, it appears to be kind of a mixed bag. ', ""Let's begin with the all-important daily percentage of increase in new cases. You can see that from April 6th to 7th, on Monday, New York's seven percent increase in the number of infections, then from the seventh to the eighth, the increase was only 6.5 percent. But the next day, it jumped up to 7.6 and today it's gone back down to 7.1 percent. "", 'But a key barometer when it comes to flattening the curve is the number of people admitted to hospitals and ICUs, and for New York, there is very encouraging news. Watch. ', '(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ', 'GOV. ANDREW CUOMO (D-NY): Change in ICU admissions is actually a negative number for the first time since we started this intense journey. ', '(END VIDEO CLIP) ', ""GALLAGHER: Meantime, on the national level, we're seeing a much steadier drop in the percentage of new cases. You can see on Monday, we had a nine percent increase and then each day the increase gets lower, today, it's at 7.8 percent. "", ""Dr. Deborah Birx says we are today where Italy was one week ago, but I also want to point out that there are some potential new hotspots including Delaware, South Dakota, Maryland, Rhode Island, and Pennsylvania. And it's interesting that Washington State and California are being touted as examples for how to flatten the curve. "", 'And yet, Los Angeles County just extended it stay at home mandate until May 15th, saying things will get much worse, but they failed to offer evidence or perspective to back up those claims -- Tucker. ', 'CARLSON: Trace, thanks so much for that. ', 'GALLAGHER: Yes. ', 'CARLSON: So you just heard the latest on where the virus is now. It is worth taking a moment to think about where it began -- Wuhan in Central China was the first place in the world to suffer an outbreak of the novel coronavirus. ', ""It's worth saying that out loud from time to time, both because it is true and materially significant, but also because a lot of the people in charge would rather you forgot it. "", ""Because Wuhan is the site of the longest running coronavirus outbreak, we ought to study what happened there carefully. It's worth knowing as much as we can about how and why the disease started and how it moved so quickly to the rest of the world. "", ""Even now, we know surprisingly little of that for certain, though, day by day, we're learning more. "", 'For example, how easily does the coronavirus spread through populations? Well, early data from Wuhan led researchers to conclude that every infected person on average infected about two and a half additional people. ', ""In epidemiological terms, that is a lot of people. It means the outbreak could double every six days and that is the assumption we've been working under ever since. "", ""Now, it looks like that assumption may have been a profound understatement of what's really happening. "", 'A new draft paper by a team of scholars in Los Alamos National Laboratory, concludes that the Wuhan coronavirus is actually highly, highly infectious. ', ""Based on extensive case analysis, the researchers estimate that the average infected Wuhan resident infected 5.7 other people. That's enough to double the epidemic in fewer than three days. "", ""Is that estimate accurate? We don't know if it is. An awful lot of the conclusions about this virus have turned out to be embarrassingly wrong. That's happened again and again, as we've told you, often with enormous consequences. "", 'But for a moment, imagine this new number from Los Alamos is correct and the size of the outbreak in Wuhan was doubling every three days. Among other things, that would mean that a huge number of people there were infected with the coronavirus. ', ""Here's the mystery. The Chinese government allowed five million residents to flee the City of Wuhan before they locked it down in January. Most of these people presumably went on to other places within China, and yet, according to Chinese government, and by the way, as well as all available evidence we now have in the West, there were no other major outbreaks in China -- not in Shanghai, not in Chengdu, not in Beijing. "", ""Meanwhile, other cities all over Europe and the United States have been brought to their knees by the virus. How could this be? It doesn't seem to make any sense at all. "", ""For some reason, almost nobody in the American media has even asked about it. That's strange. "", 'At this point, we have no real explanation for why the coronavirus spread throughout the West, but not throughout China. We should find that out. ', ""And that's far from the only thing that we don't understand about this pandemic. How about the most basic question of all -- how deadly is it? We still don't know that either. "", ""In Italy, more than 10 percent of people with confirmed cases of it have died. In Germany, just two percent have died. It seems to me that both of these numbers probably overstate the reality of the death rate given that most people are not tested until they're already sick. It's a very skewed sample. "", 'More comprehensive testing in one town in Germany suggests a death rate of just 0.37 percent. Would that number hold in every place? Or could it be that town was infected with maybe a milder form of the virus? Or is it possible that some groups of people are more vulnerable to illness than others? ', ""We know that genetics does play a major role in the way many diseases progress. Is that true with this virus? We don't know that. "", ""While we're at it, here are a few other questions that we should answer as soon as we can. Here's one. Is the virus seasonal? Will it recede in the summer as well hoping before maybe returning in the fall and winter? "", 'If infected people get immunity, how long does that immunity last? Will the virus mutate so that people who get it this year could once again get it now next year? ', 'And critically something we should be thinking about, what are the long term effects of being infected with the Wuhan coronavirus? ', ""There's mounting evidence that an awful lot of people may have it and not know they do. They have no symptoms. But do they face long term health consequences from being infected? And if so, what are those consequences? We can only guess. "", ""Those are just some of the things that we still don't know about this strange new virus from Wuhan, China. It would have been nice if the authorities had learned a lot more about it before they took such dramatic steps in response to it. "", 'Our leaders had two examples to choose from as this pandemic bore down on our country. They could have chosen the Swedish model of targeted restrictions coupled with voluntary distancing. Or they could have chosen the Chinese model -- total lockdowns, internal travel restrictions, punishment for those who step out of line. ', 'Our leaders chose the Chinese model. With every passing day, the response becomes more restrictive. Requests that people stay indoors have become orders that people stay indoors. People are being fined and arrested for driving alone, for playing catch in the park, for paddle boarding on the ocean. ', ""How are measures like that keeping us safe? The short answer is we have no idea that they are keeping us safe. In fact, as noted, we still don't know much of anything, but we're definitely not encouraged to ask too many questions about it. "", 'Dr. Anthony Fauci, who has become the face of the response to coronavirus is now suggesting that America could adopt a feature of life familiar to the population of Mainland China; another one, internal passports. ', '(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ', 'ALISYN CAMEROTA, CNN ANCHOR: Can you imagine a time where Americans carry certificates of immunity? ', ""DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES: You know, that's possible. I mean, it's one of those things that we talk about when we want to make sure that we know who the vulnerable people are and not. "", ""This is something that's being discussed. I think it might actually be -- have some merit under certain circumstances. "", '(END VIDEO CLIP) ', ""CARLSON: It might have some merit. Your papers, please? Imagine a country where illegal immigrant can work, drive, get welfare and vote all without a single authentic document. Meanwhile, more than 300 million legal citizens must produce government papers to prove their right to go outside. That could be where we're heading and with remarkable speed. "", 'For what has to be the first time in the history of this country, Easter services have been banded many places. Authorities will allow citizens to go to the supermarket, but not to practice Christianity in public. The Chinese population would recognize that, too. ', 'In Michigan, Governor Gretchen Whitmer has ordered the few stores that are still open to fence off areas that offer furniture, paint, home improvement goods. Governor Whitmer considers these ""nonessential items"" so she is prohibiting their sale. ', ""The governor of Vermont has issued similar orders for stores there; other places will doubtless follow. What would the rationale be for this? Wouldn't closing off more sections of a store increase crowding in the areas that remain open? Where exactly is the science that shows this works? "", ""Well, of course, there isn't any. They feel like doing it, so they're doing it. Politicians understand in the end that the only risk for them is in restraint. Authoritarian overreach is almost never punished. "", ""When the Coronavirus has finally passed from this country, our leaders want to be able to say they took it seriously. But there's nothing serious about reactions like this. These are mindless and destructive measures. "", 'Instead of arresting people for going to church, maybe they could pause for a minute, dive into the science and answer a few of the most basic questions first.

Do you expect some kind of public conversation about this to emerge soon? "", ""BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS CHIEF POLITICAL ANCHOR: I think so, Tucker. I mean, you saw the President today in this Taskforce briefing say that this decision that he has coming up is going to be the toughest decision of his life as he decides when and if the country is coming -- is going to open up in certain sections, how it's done specifically. "", ""And he has this second Taskforce Reopening Council, he is calling it that he is going to launch on Tuesday. That is the crux of this issue. The economy versus the health of our country, and where is the balancing act? Because on the economy side, as we've talked about, we are really taking it on the chin. "", ""CARLSON: I wonder if -- and this is a broad question, I'm just wondering your impression, I wonder if political leaders are more afraid of seeming to overreact or more afraid of seeming to under react? "", ""BAIER: Well, I think they're really concerned about the health of the American people obviously, and when you see death numbers like 777 out of New York today that's startling and more of that and the death toll affects public policy and how people think about things. "", 'But at the same time, you have stories of small business owners who are not having the easiest time getting this money that was promised them through banks. The small business loan program is not so smooth as of yet out the door, and the balancing act here, I think they are more worried about overreacting. ', ""CARLSON: Interesting. I mean, maybe this is early for this question. But do we have polling on whether Congress's response, this $2.2 trillion package is popular with the government? Do citizens feel like they're being helped by this or will be, doing know? "", ""BAIER: They're going to get that check in a couple of days, the $1,200.00 check. But again, it's been a long time since you get that money, but it's going to help a little bit. "", 'But I really think that the big issue is the money to businesses and getting it out the door. ', 'CARLSON: Right. ', ""BAIER: They're not able to open and if they can't, eventually you have to fish or cut bait, they have to let these employees go, and then you have a whole another issue. "", ""Tucker, it's going to be -- it's not going to be a flick of a switch where the country suddenly goes on and the economy kicks off. People are going to have to feel comfortable that they can go out and do things, and that's going to take leadership and a determination by Federal and state and local authorities. "", ""CARLSON: Well, that's it. I mean, you just put your finger on it right there -- Federal, state and local -- so the President -- and it was my first thought when I heard him say it. This is the biggest decision I have to make, I'll make it soon. You'll hear it soon. "", ""But a lot of these decisions are taking place the state level, aren't they? It is governors that are shutting things down. Will that change? "", ""BAIER: Well, it's going to have to and this Council on Tuesday is going to include some governors -- Democrats and Republicans. It's going to include some local officials, whether those are mayors, we don't have a complete list yet and business people as well as health experts and that decision and how it goes will determine, I think whether President Trump is reelected or not.

"", ""SEXTON: Well, it's not. I think you could make the case that CNN is effectively an ongoing contribution to the D.N.C. Now, I think that the pretense that CNN clings to, just as an organization that for example, their primetime lineup and anybody can try this -- and some of them by the way or some of the hosts are very aggressive on Twitter. So you could actually, you at home, you could probably ask, and you might even get an answer from some of the more thin skinned ones. "", ""You could say, are you a journalist or are you an opinion host? CNN is really alone of the networks in having people that are clearly opinion, but act as though they're journalists and think that then that gives them a pass for things like exactly what you're talking about, which is being effectively a propaganda arm of the D.N.C. or of a specific Democratic candidate. "", 'And I actually worked at CNN during the 2016 election, believe it or not, and what was being said off and on air in favor of Hillary Clinton and against Bernie Sanders was jaw dropping, and then of course, we found out that there was at least one case of someone giving questions. ', ""So there was a lot of bad behavior in that regard. But we don't think that CNN is ever going to be held responsible for this. They're clearly doing everything they can to stop Trump from getting reelected. If that means somebody stands in for Biden, Tucker, I think they're willing to help that effort, too. "", ""CARLSON: You make a really smart point. I mean, we just had Bret Bair who is our chief political correspondent on, I couldn't ring up an opinion out, although I tried. He just won't give his opinion. Period. Because he is a news guy. Period. "", ""There's not one person on CNN like that. Not one. Is there? "", ""SEXTON: No, not on the primetime line up.

', ""SHACKELFORD: That doesn't give people the right to discriminate against churches and treat them in this kind of way. "", ""CARLSON: Well, of course it doesn't. So Pastor, I mean, I -- I'm not against liquor stores, but liquor stores don't answer the question what happens when you die? Which is something maybe it'd be nice to know now that people are dying from this pandemic. How do you feel that liquor stores get to continue, but you can't celebrate Easter in church? "", ""HAMILTON: I think of it like this. I believe that liquor -- beer have killed more people than the coronavirus ever would. And so it's a sad case in America. "", 'Whoever thought that we will have a government in Greenville that will pass such a law that will allow the liquor stores to have curb side service, but when it comes to the church and try to disrupt a church service -- I would have never dreamed in a thousand years that America, the home of the braves and the land of the free would ever pass this law that will consider a liquor store essential, but church nonessential.

The state leaders said health outcomes and science, not politics, would drive decision-making.

Or perhaps we, as a society, have so fundamentally altered our own perception of risk aversion that we aren't willing to leave our houses unless the risk is close to zero."", ""Whatever the reason, it is simply untenable to lock Americans down for months more. Calls to do so ignore not only the catastrophic human suffering inflicted on millions -- employees who no longer have jobs, children who can no longer attend school, entrepreneurs who have seen their life's dreams and savings destroyed at the behest of the government -- but the reality of economics, which is that government cannot interminably pay everyone to stay at home."", 'GORDON G.

But between March 22 and April 4, 215 pregnant women were screened for COVID-19 in New York City, according to The New England Journal of Medicine. Four women had symptoms of COVID-19, and 29 tested positive despite being asymptomatic. This means 13.7 percent of these women had COVID-19 without knowing it -- for every symptomatic woman, there were seven others who were asymptomatic but positive.', 'If applied statewide -- a simplistic model but certainly one that would be closer to accuracy than mere confirmed cases -- this would drop the case fatality rate from 5 percent\xa0to 0.7 percent. Needless to say, such a statistic would alleviate some worry, particularly among less vulnerable populations.', 'We should also stop treating all cohorts of American society as equally vulnerable to coronavirus.', 'According to two New York University studies, the first most predictive condition for hospitalization was age: Almost half of all coronavirus patients hospitalized in New York City were over the age of 65. The next most predictive condition was obesity. And over 70 percent\xa0of hospitalized coronavirus patients had a chronic condition.', 'This should be no surprise: As of April 12, the New York City Health Department reported 128 fatalities among people with no underlying conditions and just 26 deaths among people below age 45 with no underlying conditions. There were 42,524 diagnosed cases of COVID-19 for New Yorkers under age 45, meaning that the case fatality rate -- again, a seriously high-end estimate given the fact that asymptomatic people have not been tested -- for those with no underlying health conditions below age 45 is 0.06 percent.\xa0In other words, 9,397 out of every 10,000 young, healthy people who get coronavirus will not die -- and the number is likely higher than that.', 'This means that we should be looking to send young, healthy people back to work, and urging social distancing and isolation for those who are elderly or have preexisting conditions that raise coronavirus risks.', 'CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP', 'We should retain social distancing for the young and healthy, urge mask-wearing and perform contact tracing when hot spots arise.

', ""One, what's your reaction to the report? And how much did those lost weeks cost us? "", ""DR. TOM INGLESBY, JOHNS HOPKINS BLOOMBERG SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH: So, Chris, I can't say who in the administration knew what and when, but I would say that that article reinforces what we've heard along the way, which is that many in the administration were very worried about this as early as January and February. And that seems pretty clear now. And I'd also say that if we had acted on some of those mornings earlier, we would be in a much better position in terms of diagnostics and possibly masks and personal protective equipment and getting our hospitals ready. "", 'WALLACE: When you say be in a much better position, if we had imposed social distancing, stay-at-home, at the end of January, and early February, would there be a dramatic -- dramatically less number -- smaller number of cases and deaths? ', ""INGLESBY: Yes, I'm not sure we would've been able to get the collective political will to do it as early as January and February because we didn't really know when we had cases, but if we had done a lot of diagnostic testing earlier, it's possible we would have seen enough disease to get the will to do that in February. And, yes, the earlier we put in place social distancing, the earlier we would have gotten to a peak and to a better place where we can start to think about responding. "", ""WALLACE: Let's talk about where we are right now. The U.S. now has more than a half million coronavirus cases. And this week, we had 2,000 deaths in a single day. "", 'So we keep talking about that curve. Are we at the peak of that curve or even on the downslope as some public health officials are now saying? ', 'INGLESBY: It looks like in the last few days, if you look across the country and you average out the numbers, that we are near a plateau in the number of cases, which would be reaching a peak, and in some places like New York, which has had a terrible disease -- New York City, which has terrible, terrible impact with this epidemic, we have a few days of similar case counts day-to-day. And so, that is what we might call a peak. ', ""It doesn't mean that the downslope of the peak is going to be fast. It could be that this plateau carries on for a while. And we've seen in other countries where they started to have lower case counts over time that it can take days and weeks for the numbers to even get cut in half. "", ""So I think what we may be at a peak, we hope we are, it's still going to take time for us to start to bring the case numbers down, especially in places which are the biggest hot spots. "", ""WALLACE: Well, let's talk about that. There are all kinds of models where talking about. First, there was a model that 100,000 to 200,000 people in the U.S. would die from the disease. Now the latest model is 60,000. "", ""One, how reliable are these models? And what's your projection for how many deaths we're likely to see from the coronavirus here in the U.S.? "", ""INGLESBY: So, all models are just approximations. They all have their strengths and limits. And so, it's useful to look at many models and trying to get a general sense of things. I think the model you're referring to has been one of the White House has been using, which has had lowered estimates of total number of people who might die from this, which is a model that really tries to fit the experience of Wuhan, China, onto the United States as a whole. "", ""I think it's good for an overall, general estimate of what might happen, but in terms of specific days when things will happen or specific numbers, I'm not confident in any particular model. I think it's hard to see out beyond a couple of weeks. And I think one of the biggest factors is that it will depend on what we do as a country. "", ""This isn't preordained what the final outcome will be in terms of overall numbers. It depends on our collective reaction, what we do with social distancing, whether or not we develop therapies over time that work. Our overall ability to track cases and to build public health capacity around the country, that's going to be crucial for us to try and get control of this over time. "", 'WALLACE: Well, let me pick up on that, Doctor, because the big question right now is whether President Trump is going to lift his stay at guidelines on April 30th and begin urging leaders and businesses to reopen the country. ', ""Here's the president talking about that. "", '(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ', ""DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I'm going to have to make a decision and I only hope to God that it's the right decision. But I would say without question it's the biggest decision I've ever had to make. "", '(END VIDEO CLIP) ', ""WALLACE: The president says that he'll consult with public health experts, with business leaders. What's your recommendation? "", 'INGLESBY: I think it will be too soon to reopen the country on May 1st. I think there may be parts of the country that have such good numbers and can build up such public health capacity and get diagnostic testing ability in place. Some perhaps in May but it seems like it may be May or June before the best places in the country -- the most ready places in the country are likely to have all those things in place. ', ""I just think for perspective, it's important to know that the U.S. has more cases than any country in the world, and no country has reopened altogether in the way that I think is being considered. So, even when we do start to ease social distancing, it will need to be very careful, because if we don't -- if we're -- if we're not careful when we ease social distancing, we'll recreate the conditions that existed back in early March. We could have another peak the way that we have on this month. "", ""So, we're going to have to be really be careful about it, think about keeping people at safe distances from each other whenever possible, wearing cloth masks, putting up physical barriers and work spaces if that's possible. We have to think about work differently. "", ""So I think it's going to be too soon unfortunately by the end of this month. The numbers aren't going to be anywhere close in many places in the country to do that for the whole country. "", ""WALLACE: Let me pick up on that, because your Center for Health Security, the center that you head, is saying that when -- before we open and then as we open, that there has to be much more testing. There has to be really a tremendous amount more because there's very little right now, of contact tracing and then for people who still have the disease, that there has to be quarantining. "", 'The president was asked about more testing this week. Take a look. ', '(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ', ""TRUMP: We're going to see if we have it. Do you need it? No. Is it a nice thing to do? Yes. We're talking about 325 million people and that's not going to happen. "", '(END VIDEO CLIP) ', ""WALLACE: Dr. Inglesby, the president says we've already conducted 2 million tests. How many more -- when you talk about random testing, how many more tests are you talking about? And your center is also talking about the need for 100,000 more contact tracers? "", ""INGLESBY: So, first on diagnostic testing, we have done a lot of testing. But the ultimate number, the overall number is less important than when we have the ability to trust anyone who has symptoms that might be COVID. Right now, we can't do that in most places in the country, there's just not enough capacity. We need to be able to have the capacity. "", ""So, if someone says, I feel like I'm getting a flu or pneumonia, they can walk into a clinic or a hospital or a testing center and get that test that day and get the results hopefully that day, so that they can be in isolation, that we can identify their contacts. So, that number is going to differ from state to state depending on population and how they're organized, but it's going to need to be a lot more than it is now because in many places in the country, we can't get testing for mild or moderate cases. "", ""In terms of tracking cases and contacts, that's the strategy that countries have had that have had most success have used to bring the numbers down. So, for example, South Korea, New Zealand, Australia, Iceland, they're all using very, very active case finding and contact-tracing and getting people in quarantine who are exposed to COVID cases. And using that strategy, they've been able to get their numbers way down. "", ""We don't have that capacity in the country, and so, it's going to take a lot of people to get that built. "", ""WALLACE: I've got one big question left. I got a little bit more than a minute left to -- for you to answer it. "", 'President Trump is saying that he may take action this week against the World Health Organization, and he and the head of the WHO, Dr. Tedros, have gotten in the real war of words over the past week. ', 'Take a look. ', '(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ', 'TRUMP: They called it wrong. They called it wrong. They really -- they missed the call. ', ""DR. TEDROS ADHANOM GHEBREYESUS, DIRECTOR-GENERAL, WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION: If you don't want many more body bags, then you refrain from politicizing it. "", ""TRUMP: I can't believe he is talking about politics when you look at the relationship they have to China. "", '(END VIDEO CLIP) ', ""WALLACE: Has the WHO mishandled the crisis? Do they side with China? And what you think of the idea that the president seems to be raising of cutting the U.S.'s contribution of $450 million a year to the WHO? "", ""INGLESBY: So, the U.S. needs the World Health Organization to function properly. It is an organization that helps the world get prepared and respond to this. We're going to need the world to recover from COVID and we're going to get normalcy back around the world. "", ""We need the WHO. I don't think that they have been favoring one country over another, it's a really difficult situation. "", ""But overall, I think the U.S. should continue to do what it's been doing overtime, which is work very closely with the World Health Organization and support its work.

I don't want to make any predictions, but I'm hopeful that we will. "", ""But I don't think we'll play in front of fans. I think initially we'll play just for the T.V. cameras with essential personnel and players. \xa0And I think that's a great thing, because I think we need things to cheer for. We need things to get excited about. We want a communal experience so we can all root for our favorite teams. "", ""That's going to be a big step, and I think the NBA recognizes that that's a responsibility we have and that we'll undertake it as soon as it's safe, because we won't do anything to jeopardize the safety of our players or employees.

You know, we -- the scientists are going to come up with solutions, and when they do and when we have that confidence, people will go back. \xa0We're already taking the precautions and already going through the process at the American Airlines Center to say, OK, what do we need to do in terms of sterilization, sanitization, repeat cleaning, in terms of informing people that, you know, the seat that they're in has been cleaned, you know, two hours ago or three hours ago, whatever it may be. And so, we'll take those necessary steps. \xa0So, once -- once the science is in place and we start to feel confident, then the facilities and the arenas and stadiums, et cetera will take the steps to make sure that it's clean. And then once we start going through, confidence will build. \xa0WALLACE: You have also invested in about 150 small businesses as part of your work on Shark Tank. I know that you support the $2 trillion program, bailout, whatever you want to call it, a big chunk of which is for small businesses. \xa0But I also know you think it would work better, instead of the Payroll Protection Plan, where small businesses have to apply for loans, if instead they just got overdraft protection. \xa0How would that work? "", ""CUBAN: Very simply. So with your bank where you already have a checking account, you would work with the banks to designate, here's my rent, here's my landlord that I write checks to, here's my utilities that I write checks to, here's what I do for payroll. And for those checks, they won't bounce. And the reason you do it that way is you reduce all the friction. \xa0Right now, we're seeing all the friction from the banks, but the distribute loans or approve loans and then distribute the PPC loans and how it's slowing everything down, and that's leading to companies being laid off -- I mean, employees being laid off and companies closing. \xa0With an overdraft protection program, companies could just continue as usual, pay their payrolls, pay their insurance, pay the utilities, rent, et cetera, and they wouldn't have that fear that they wouldn't be able to make those payments. \xa0And so, I always just felt that the overdraft protection program would work a whole lot better.\xa0 WALLACE: You also say that the government should take a hard line when dealing with big corporations, for instance, the airlines, which the president is talking to this weekend -- don't let the CEOs do anything to set the terms for how they're going to be bailed out. \xa0CUBAN: Yes, without question. I mean look, they're coming for money for a reason. And this is taxpayer money. So I'm not saying don't give them money, but there needs to be terms and conditions that really put the taxpayer first. \xa0If we're going to give them a loan, that's great. But let's ask for equity. Let's ask for equity kickers. "", ""I use Warren Buffet as an example. When he helped bailout Bank of America in the early 2010 timeframe, he gave them $5 billion as a loan, but he also got warrants and options and other things that he then turned into a $12 billion profit. We should be able to do that for American citizens. \xa0And part two to that, Chris, is you know, it also can show other benefits for the airlines. The government buys a lot of commercial air travel. So, it's not inconceivable that we -- as part of this deal, we can pre-pay for commercial travel and work out programs with the airlines to have federal employees travel to build confidence in the airlines again. \xa0So have the government pre-pay however many hundreds of millions of dollars that we typically spend with those airlines; work on a sanitation program to make sure that the insides of those airlines are safe when we go to fly them. \xa0Have federal employees fly in those newly safe airlines and develop confidence so that that then can be (ph) conveyed to the general public. Then they're going to be more likely to travel. That will lead to the airlines coming back sooner. \xa0WALLACE: Finally, you talked back in 2019 about running for president before and you finally decided not to do so, and the other day you said you were reconsidering. \xa0Now I don't have to tell you, I suspect you know this already, but the deadline for filing as an independent candidate has already passed in some states and is about to in other states. \xa0So I know Mark Cuban likes publicity as much as the next person, maybe more than the next person. You're not really serious about this, are you? \xa0CUBAN: Hey, (ph) unique circumstances, you just never know, Chris. I never would have considered it prior to a month ago. But now things are changing rapidly and dramatically. "", ""So there's different ways to get through those issues you mentioned, so I'm not saying no, but it's not certain something that I'm actively pursuing. I'm just keeping the door open. \xa0WALLACE: Then are you saying that this is something that is serious? \xa0CUBAN: As it is today, I'd say probably not, that it's not going to happen. "", ""But again, so much can change. You just never know. This is not something we've seen before. This is obviously a unique set of circumstances, and so I'm just not going to say no. It's just -- you just don't know what can happen between now and November. \xa0WALLACE: Mark Cuban, you're always interesting and you're always provocative. Thanks so much for sharing part of your Easter weekend with us. \xa0CUBAN: Great, thanks for having me, Chris, and stay safe.

', ""Mayor, national public health officials keep talking about Washington as the next potential hot spot. And you've said that you worry that Washington could be in the second wave of virus outbreaks. "", ""So what is it that you're seeing that worries you? "", 'MAYOR MURIEL BOWSER (D), WASHINGTON D.C.: Well, certainly, Chris, we are getting prepared and we, like all cities and states around the country, are looking at various models to see what they tell us about when our medical surge will happen. And we expect that that could happen in Washington, D.C., in June. ', 'Our residents are doing everything that we ask so that we can push down the number of peak cases and push out when that surge would happen in D.C. ', 'WALLACE: I want to pick up on what you just said because you are working off a model that says that Washington is going to hit its peak, not an April, as New York is now, or even May, but in late June. ', 'Why so late in Washington? ', 'BOWSER: Well, we think that all of the interventions that we put in place very aggressively in the early part of March, closing our schools, shutting down our bars and restaurants, closing essential businesses in Washington, D.C., has pushed out when the peak might occur. And we --- we just know. We see that in a number that there are cities who are experiencing a surge in cases and hospitalizations now and we know and we see from what we see on the ground in testing that show that our peak will come later. ', ""WALLACE: Meanwhile, it's not just a health crisis for you. D.C. is getting hammered economically. And I want to put up some numbers. "", ""Almost 60,000 residents have filed for unemployment claims since March 13th. That's more than double the 27,000 who filed for unemployment in D.C. all of last year. "", 'Mayor Bowser, how serious is the economic situation in Washington right now? ', ""BOWSER: Well, it's -- it's very serious, as it is in cities and states around the country. We don't think that we're any different except we went into this pandemic in a very strong position, Chris. You showed our unemployment filings for 2019. And we have exceeded that just in five weeks going into this. "", 'So we went into this pandemic fiscally strong, strong employment, growing business space and, of course, growing hospitality and tourism. And it was our hospitality and tourism sector that was struck first with closing our convention center, shutting down mass gatherings, even shutting down our cherry blossom festival. So all of those things are hitting our hotels, restaurants and bars and our workers very significantly. ', ""So we know that how we slowly turn on the economy and we're looking to national experts and the CDC to tell us what things can slowly come back on so we can get people back to work. "", 'WALLACE: Well, let me pick up on that because, as I was just discussing earlier, President Trump is considering, and in fact is going to set up a counsel -- a reopening the country counsel this week, is considering lifting his stay-at-home guidelines as early as the end of this month, and beginning to reopen the economy. ', 'If the president goes ahead and does that, will you listen to him? ', ""BOWSER: Well, we know, Chris, that the most optimistic models demonstrate the -- and the ones that the White House task force has pointed to repeatedly, are based on keeping stay-at-home directive in place through the end of May. So we are -- what we're looking for is a staying periods of decreasing infection, sustained periods of decreasing hospitalizations. And that will be a signal to us in Washington that we see the containment of this virus and also that our medical system can withhold growing hospitalizations. "", ""And I think that's going to be key, not only for us in Washington, D.C., but for the entire nation. But keep in mind that the most optimistic modeling points to interventions remaining in place through the end of May. "", ""WALLACE: You say the end of May. As I -- as I pointed out, the president's talking about maybe the end of April, May 1st. So you're saying if -- if he starts saying we're going to start relaxing those guidelines, which aren't an order, you're the mayor, you're in charge in D.C., are you saying you won't necessarily follow his direction? "", ""BOWSER: I'm saying that we're going to follow what the data on the ground tells us. As we have her directly, the president hasn't issued any stay-at- home orders for any jurisdiction in the United States of America. And we are looking to our own experience in Washington, D.C. Are levels of infection decreasing? Are hospitalizations decreasing? Do we see the number of lives lost in our city decreasing? And we know when we see sustained level of those numbers, just for -- for -- for a few examples, then that is a trigger to us to tell us how we can start to get our economy going again. "", ""But we're also looking to examples around the world. We know we can't just flip a switch and have everything go back to normal, because if we do that, we could suffer a rebound and lose all of the gains that we've made by strict social distancing in our town. "", ""WALLACE: Finally, Mayor, I don't have to tell you, African-Americans are getting hit much harder by this virus than any other group. I want to put up some -- some numbers. A CDC study found that 33 percent of hospitalized patients in this study were black, although they made up only 18 percent of the population in those areas. "", 'Mayor Bowser, how do you explain that? ', ""BOWSER: Well, we know, Chris, and this virus has put a spotlight on the disproportionate number of African-Americans who suffer from chronic disease. And it's also put a spotlight on the health disparities that have plagued African-Americans for generations. And you can trace slavery, racism, Jim Crow rules and laws in our country. You can also look to how many African-Americans are living in substandard housing conditions, which we know impact the levels of asthma. But diabetes and heart disease, this virus is violently attacking. "", 'So while this is not new during the Covid-19 response, it certainly calls for national and local actions that are going to change the trajectory for African-Americans health outcomes in our nation.

"", ""ARI FLEISCHER, FORMER WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: Chris, the first thing you have to recognize is the Democratic Party as a whole has moved sharply to the left. There was -- there was a Gallup poll that came out a couple months ago that said 24 percent of the Democrats consider themselves liberal when Bill Clinton was president. Today, 51 percent consider themselves liberal. So the party's shifted. "", ""But what's happened to Joe Biden is he's renounced previous positions he used to hold. On abortion, for example, the overwhelming bipartisan position was opposition to federally funded abortions. He's now opposed to that. He wants federally funded abortions. He's changed his position on -- from Obamacare, where he was against government controlled healthcare, the public option. Now he's for it. He's for a green new deal. He's for free college, even if you don't have -- and you don't have to pay for it. A host of issues he's shifted left because the Democratic Party has shifted left. "", ""WALLACE: So, Juan, you just heard Ari make what will undoubtedly be the Trump White House case, which is it's too late, that Biden is already too far to the left. "", 'Do you agree with that, and how do you see him playing this where, yes, he reaches out to the Biden -- the Sanders supporters, because there still are some significant differences between Biden and Sanders -- ', 'JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST: Yes. ', 'WALLACE: On Medicare for all and the green new deal, how does he win them over but still not be seen as a socialist, at least in a credible sense, as the president will try to portray him? ', ""WILLIAMS: Well, I think we're in a -- Chris, we're in a politically difficult moment for Joe Biden in that, you know, usually when a candidate has the nomination in hand, that candidate, looking towards the general election, moves to the center, not to the left or the right. "", ""But in this case, I think you see Biden saying, I've got to move to the left somewhat to build a bridge to the Bernie Bros, to the people who were alienated in 2016 by Hillary Clinton, think the establishment Democrats that rigged the whole election against them. And I think what he's doing is by reaching out, lowering the age of eligibility for Medicare to 60 and making college education more affordable, I don't think that, thanks to Bernie Sanders, those are any longer seen as socialist, radical, left-wing ideas. "", 'At a time of rising income inequality in the country, those -- those ideas are pretty mainstream. ', 'WALLACE: Right. ', ""WILLIAMS: And, politically, I don't think that the president will be able to say this is socialism. Most people will say it's pragmatic. "", ""WALLACE: Then, there is Barack Obama's continued silence about his own former vice president. And President Trump had some fun with that this week. "", 'Take a look. ', '(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ', ""DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: It does amaze me that President Obama hasn't supported sleepy Joe. It just hasn't happened. When's it going to happen? When is it going to happen? When isn't he? He knows something that you don't know. "", '(END VIDEO CLIP) ', 'WALLACE: Gillian, what do you think is taking Barack Obama so long to come out in endorsing and in strong support for his former vice president? ', ""GILLIAN TURNER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Well, what we do know is that his team, for the last year and a half, has said he's planning to stay out of the campaign fray because he feels that's with the appropriate role for a former president is, and he's going to get in once the Democrats have coalesced around a single candidate. "", ""So I would anticipate, based on that, that any day now he's going to throw his full weight behind Biden. And when he does, it's going to be a huge boost for Biden. I think President Obama's ratings among the Democrats are still astronomically high, somewhere in the 90th percentile, and I think those very same Americans are super eager to hear from President Obama on the coronavirus pandemic, something else he's not really spoken out about a lot. So everyone's going to be tuned in wherever he does this, whether it's online or in front of crowds, touting Vice President Biden. "", ""I would say, Chris, quickly, that the big risk for Biden with support from President Obama is that he's likely to outshine him on the trail. He's a great orator and I think that's something that Biden is probably thinking long and hard about, you know, if he wants to be following at all -- after, you know, President Obama introduces him at rally after rally, if we have rallies. "", 'WALLACE: Gillian, I want to stay with you and ask you about this really stunning report in ""The New York Times"" this morning I talked about with Dr. Dr. Inglesby, that top health officials within the administrations were warning the president from mid-January on about the real threat of this pandemic and that it took weeks, in a sense really more than a month, for President Trump to respond. ', 'How damaging do you think that is to the president? ', ""TURNER: Well, President Trump and the rest of the White House comms team have been pushing back on that report really hard the last two days. Whoever ends up being right or wrong in this scenario, I think the one thing, Chris, that everybody, all Americans, can really agree on is the role that China has played. China's government, as separate and distinct from the Chinese people, China's communist party, the government. We now know, thanks to leaked U.S. intelligence reports and other studies, that they spent weeks and months under reporting the real case numbers in Wuhan during the early days of the outbreak. "", ""I talk -- I spoke to Peter Navarro, the trade advisor, last week. He said he thinks one of the reasons China hedged and delayed and delayed reporting for so long was because they were trying to hoard PPE and medical equipment. So I think the real shoe that's still to drop here is the American people really learning in depth about the role that China's government played in covering this up, as opposed to, I think, we can give our own government the benefit of the doubt that they didn't willfully ignore warnings that hundreds of thousands of Americans were going to die. "", ""If it turns out to be an intelligence oversight or bad guidance given to the president, we'll have to grapple with that in the fallout from that over the coming years for sure. "", 'WALLACE: Juan, I -- we\'re running out of time, so I need a quick answer for you on this. Your reaction to ""The New York Times"" report today about the president getting all these reports, including at least two in January from his secretary of Health and Human Services, Secretary Azar? ', ""WILLIAMS: Well, I don't think it's any great revelation that we had a slow response as a country. I'll leave all the finger-pointing and backbiting to others. As Gillian was just saying, I mean they'll -- we'll have reviews. "", ""But -- and -- but, you know, the key here is moving forward. And I think moving forward, I think, we have to look at how the president's conducting himself. Are we getting the tests right now quickly? Are we moving towards understanding how people who have had the virus can act possibly on an immune basis to help us? All of that. "", 'I don\'t think these briefings the president\'s been holding are any help. Even the conservative ""Wall Street Journal"" editorial page has said he\'s turned it into the Trump show. So I think we need trust, credibility, like Dr. Inglesby at the top of this show, Chris. We need those voices, Dr. Fauci, less so than the president attacking the WHO and the reporters. ', 'WALLACE: Yes, I want to pick up on the briefings with you as a communications professional, Ari, because the president did get high marks for his White House briefings, at least originally. But in more recent days, certainly this week you saw him getting into fights with governors he did not think were sufficiently appreciative, or reporters.

"", '(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ', 'QUESTION: You asked him (pH) when she was appointed -- ', 'DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Now, look -- look -- ', 'QUESTION: I told you when she was appointed by your administration -- ', ""TRUMP: You're a third-rate reporter and what you just said is a disgrace. "", '(END VIDEO CLIP) ', 'WALLACE: Ari, if you were advising the president, what would you tell him about these briefings? ', ""FLEISCHER: Well, I've been saying this for weeks, Chris, I think the briefings are extremely helpful. It is proper and wise for the president of the United States, in a crisis, to be regularly accessible. But the briefings should be no longer than 30 minutes' worth of Q&As. The longer it goes on like that, reporters run out of good questions and it just becomes the old war of one truculent side against another.

And now, a new study has uncovered more of its secrets, finding that the people of Nazareth rejected Roman culture and even revolted against the Roman Empire around A.D. 70.', 'The researcher of the study also found that Nazareth was likely larger than thought during the time of Jesus. The findings might help to explain some stories of Jesus described in the bible.', 'Nazareth\'s opposition to Roman cultural practices and objects would have stood in stark contrast to its neighbor, a city called Sepphoris, which embraced Roman culture, including imported objects. ""Cultural separation may have created what was, in effect, an invisible barrier between Nazareth and Sepphoris,"" wrote study author Ken Dark, director of the Nazareth Archaeological Project, in his recently published book ""Roman-Period and Byzantine Nazareth and Its Hinterland"" (Routledge, 2020).', ""Related:\xa0See Images of the 'Jesus' House and Nazareth Artifacts"", 'Dark also found that people in Nazareth may have resisted the Romans during a revolt around A.D. 70, digging refuge caves to protect themselves from Roman soldiers. This contrasts with Sepphoris where coins minted at the time of the revolt say that it was a ""city of peace"" where inhabitants did not revolt. The study also found that people within or near Sepphoris were willing to use imported Roman pottery styles while people within or near Nazareth stuck to local styles and were particularly fond of vessels made of limestone, a material considered pure under Jewish religious laws of the time.', 'Another contrast, Dark noted, is that farmers near Sepphoris used human waste as manure despite this practice being forbidden under some interpretations of ancient Jewish religious law; meanwhile, farmers near Nazareth avoided this practice.', 'People buried in Nazareth also seem to have preferred what archaeologists call ""kokhim"" tombs, which are cut into rock and have an entrance closed off with a rolling stone — a type of tomb that is similar to\xa0the one where Jesus was buried\xa0in the New Testament. This tomb design is seen in other parts of Israel and those buried in the tombs may ""have wanted to express a strongly Jewish identity,"" Dark wrote in his book.', 'Dark has been conducting surveys and excavations in Nazareth for\xa0many years\xa0and, in preparing his study, also reviewed previous archaeological work at Nazareth by other archaeologists.', 'Dark emphasized that his study is not meant to shed light on the bible, but the results may help to explain some stories of\xa0Jesus\xa0that are told in the Bible.', 'Related:\xa0The Holy Land: 7 Amazing Archaeological Finds', 'For instance,\xa0biblical stories\xa0say that, despite growing up in Nazareth, Jesus was poorly received when he visited his hometown during his ministry. Even some of his own family members were not happy with him. According to the Gospel of Mark, Jesus said that ""a prophet is not without honor except in his own town, among his relatives and in his own home"" (Mark 6:4).', 'The archaeology of Nazareth, which shows that people in the area strongly rejected Roman objects, values and practices regarded as impure, may have contrasted with some of Jesus\' teachings, Dark told Live Science. ""The all-encompassing message of salvation being presented by Jesus might also have been controversial to local people who may have sought to create a cultural barrier between themselves and the Romans.""', 'Also ""comparing the teachings of Jesus about religious purity with what seems from archaeological evidence to have been the local cultural attitudes of people in Nazareth, suggests that local people in Nazareth would also have found those teachings in contrast with their own perceptions of what was pure and impure,"" Dark said.', 'In the biblical stories, Jesus expresses a lenient view of ritual purity, at least in regard for food, saying that ""there is nothing outside a person that by going in can defile, but the things that come out are what defile"" (Mark 7:14). This seems to contrast with Dark\'s and others\' archaeological findings at Nazareth, which suggest that people in the town practiced a strict interpretation of purity.', 'Nazareth may have been bigger than originally believed, based on the structures that have been discovered there. ""Excavated evidence from work by numerous archaeologists over more than a century demonstrates the existence of domestic structures, storage facilities and hiding places in central Nazareth dating from the Roman period,"" Dark wrote in his book.', 'Related:\xa0Proof of Jesus Christ? 7 Pieces of Evidence Debated', '""There is evidence of agriculture, quarrying and rock-cut tombs,"" Dark wrote. In the past, some scholars thought Nazareth was a very small settlement in Jesus\' time, possibly no bigger than a hamlet. The archaeological remains analyzed by Dark suggest that, while Nazareth was not as large as Sepphoris, it was larger than originally believed.', 'Dark\'s research in Nazareth is ongoing and a book set to be published later this year will present detailed results from a specific site in Nazareth known as the ""Sisters of Nazareth"" convent.', 'Originally published on\xa0Live Science.\xa0']"

The small business initiative ran out of money last week amid overwhelming demand as the economy cratered and millions were laid off.

Democrats are pushing to include a requirement in the measure, which is likely to include $25 billion for testing, that the Trump administration establish a national testing strategy, a move the president and Republicans have resisted, insisting on leaving those decisions to each state. The impasse hindering the latest round of federal aid to respond to the coronavirus pandemic reflects a broader disagreement over how to handle testing, a crucial element of the government response on which the Trump administration has been roundly criticized for falling short. President Trump and members of his team have boasted repeatedly about the amount of testing available and pressured governors to accelerate testing in their states.”House expected to vote on proxy voting, rule changes Thursday - Roll Call: “The House is expected to vote as soon as Thursday on a major, but temporary, change to the chamber's voting rules to allow for proxy voting as travel and large gatherings continue to pose public health risks during the coronavirus pandemic. Lawmakers are expected to have to return to Washington this week to vote on an update to coronavirus pandemic aid for small businesses, and House leaders plan to use the session to also approve an emergency proxy-voting procedure in response to the health crisis. The change would allow an absent lawmaker to designate a colleague to vote on House floor matters on their behalf. House Majority Leader\xa0Steny H. Hoyer, D-Md., announced late Monday night that if the Senate passes the small-business aid in their Tuesday pro forma session, the House could meet as soon as Thursday at 10 a.m., when a proxy-voting resolution may be brought for a vote.”THE RULEBOOK: NO MATTER HOW THIN YOU SLICE IT“The INFINITE DIVISIBILITY of matter, or, in other words, the INFINITE divisibility of a FINITE thing, extending even to the minutest atom, is a point agreed among geometricians, though not less incomprehensible to common-sense than any of those mysteries in religion, against which the batteries of infidelity have been so industriously leveled.” –\xa0Alexander Hamilton,\xa0Federalist No. 31TIME OUT: BUMP IN THE NIGHTNature: “Gravitational-wave astronomers have for the first time detected a collision between two black holes of substantially different masses – opening up a new vista on astrophysics and on the physics of gravity. The event offers the first unmistakable evidence from these faint space-time ripples that at least one black hole was spinning before merging, giving astronomers rare insight into a key property of these dark objects. ‘It’s an exceptional event,’ said\xa0Maya Fishbach, an astrophysicist at the University of Chicago in Illinois. Similar mergers on which data have been published all took place between black holes with roughly equal masses, so this new one dramatically upsets that pattern, she says. The collision was detected last year, and was unveiled on 18 April by Fishbach and her collaborators at a virtual meeting of the American Physical Society, held entirely online because of the coronavirus pandemic.”Flag on the play?\xa0- Email us at\xa0HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM\xa0with your tips, comments or questions.SCOREBOARDTRUMP JOB PERFORMANCEAverage approval:\xa046 percentAverage disapproval:\xa049.2 percentNet Score:\xa0-3.2 pointsChange from one week ago:\xa0↓\xa00.2 points[Average includes: NBC News/WSJ: 46% approve - 51% disapprove; Gallup: 43% approve - 54% disapprove; Fox News: 49% approve - 49% disapprove; Monmouth University: 46% approve - 49% disapprove; CNBC: 46% approve - 43% disapprove.]\xa0WANT MORE HALFTIME REPORT?\nYou can join Chris and Brianna every day on Fox Nation.

The White House-driven initiative is expected to center on suspending federal regulations for small businesses and expanding an existing administration program that requires agencies to revoke two regulations for every new one they issue, the two people said. While the plan remains in flux, changes could affect environmental policy, labor policy, workplace safety and health care, among other areas. The White House is also likely to seek to make permanent some temporary regulations issued by agencies over the past few weeks to respond to the coronavirus pandemic.”Trump to bar foreign workers, a move he says will help economy -\xa0WSJ: “President Trump said he plans to sign an executive order temporarily suspending immigration into the U.S., saying he was doing so to protect American jobs as the novel coronavirus has taken a sharp toll on the economy. ... Administration officials said the order wouldn’t make substantial changes to current U.S. policy. Even without an executive order, the administration has already all but ceased nearly every form of immigration. Most visa processing has been halted, meaning almost no one can apply for a visa to visit or move to the U.S. Visa interviews and citizenship ceremonies have been post\xadponed and the refugee program paused, The Wall Street Journal has previously reported. Migrants caught crossing the border are now immediately expelled once they are found.”MORE SOUTHERN STATES MOVE TO GRADUAL OPENINGNYT: “Residents of Georgia will be allowed on Friday to return to the gym and get haircuts, pedicures, massages and tattoos. Next Monday, they can dine again in restaurants and go to the movies. With that announcement, Gov.\xa0Brian Kemp\xa0of Georgia on Monday joined officials in other states who are moving ahead with plans to relax restrictions intended to curb the spread of the coronavirus, despite signs that the outbreak is just beginning to strike some parts of the country. In Tennessee, Gov.\xa0Bill Lee\xa0said on Monday that he was not extending his “safer-at-home” order that is set to expire on April 30. … In South Carolina, Gov.\xa0Henry McMaster, a Republican, said on Monday that department stores and some other retail businesses that had previously been deemed nonessential would be allowed to reopen on Tuesday, but they must abide by social distancing guidelines. People will also be able to gain access to public beaches on Tuesday.”Iowa deploys National Guard to help meatpackers - Bloomberg: “Hundreds of National Guard personnel are being activated in Iowa as coronavirus sweeps through meat-processing plants in a state that accounts for about a third of U.S. pork supply. Iowa Governor\xa0Kim Reynolds\xa0said 250 National Guard members have been moved to full-time federal duty status and could help with testing and contact tracing for workers at plants operated by Tyson Foods Inc. and National Beef Packing Co. Activating guard soldiers is the latest attempt to contain the disease, which has forced a growing number of slaughterhouses and meat-processing plants to slow or halt operations. The disruptions are stoking concerns for eventual fresh-meat shortages in grocery stores as well leaving some farmers without a market for their animals. That’s pushing down prices for hogs and cattle, while making meat more expensive. Wholesale pork posted its biggest three-day gain in six years.”Most Americans expect quarantine to last until summer - WaPo: “A majority say it could be June or later before it will be safe for larger gatherings to take place again, according to a Washington Post-University of Maryland poll. Most Americans – 54 percent – give the president negative marks for his handling of the outbreak in this country and offer mixed reviews for the federal government as a whole. By contrast, 72 percent of Americans give positive ratings to the governors of their states for the way they have dealt with the crisis, with workers also rating their employers positively.”BIDEN GETS MONEY BOOST BUT STILL TRAILS MASSIVELYNYT: “Joseph R. Biden Jr.\xa0and the Democratic Party could raise almost $1 million every single day between now and November, and he would still barely catch up to what President Trump and the Republican Party had in the bank at the start of April — let alone what Mr. Trump will have by Election Day. New fund-raising figures released late Monday show the depth of the financial hole in which Mr. Biden finds himself at the start of the general election campaign: The presumptive Democratic nominee and his party are nearly $187 million behind the Republican National Committee and Mr. Trump, who has spent the last three years stockpiling his huge war chest. The sheer size of Mr. Trump’s early advantage creates a unique set of financial and political pressures for Mr. Biden. He must find ways to both expand his appeal to small online contributors and attract huge seven- and eight-figure checks to the outside super PACs supporting him — all while sheltered in his Delaware home because of the coronavirus.”Lauds Michelle Obama but downplays veep talk - KDKA: “Joe Biden says he would take\xa0Michelle Obama\xa0to be his running mate for the 2020 presidential election. The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee told KDKA’s Jon Delano that the former first lady would be a strong addition as VP if he thought she would accept the nomination. ‘I’d take her in a heartbeat,’ Biden said on Monday. ‘She’s brilliant. She knows the way around. She is a really fine woman. The Obamas are great friends.’ ‘I don’t think she has any desire to live near the White House again,’ Biden added. Biden did say it is still early in the process of selecting a vice president. ‘In terms of who to pick, we’re just beginning the process,’ Biden told KDKA. ‘We’ll shortly name the committee to review this and begin to look through the backgrounds of the various potential nominees. And that’s just getting underway.’”PLAY-BY-PLAYWhere’s the surgeon general?\xa0-\xa0PoliticoNetanyahu reaches power-sharing agreement\xa0-\xa0The Jerusalem PostAUDIBLE: SACKED“Our parks are closed down, so a lot of our parks staff, they patrol around just to make sure people aren't in there with contact sports and things.

I am Brazilian by birth and American by choice. All my extended family is still there and subjected to the whims of a wannabe dictator. I have very strong (negative) feelings about populist governments, either catering to the right or to the left, North or South of the Equator. You can only imagine how it pains me to see the Republic there transformed into the bananas it is frequently thought to be. Thank you for your continuous centered reporting. As your other reader said, it is a highlight of my afternoons.” –\xa0Walter Bonomo, Mooresvile, N.C.\n[Ed. note: Well, we are very pleased to be part of your day, Mr. Bonomo! I’m also glad my try at international analysis passed muster with an expert. I didn’t want to bore readers who come here for domestic politics, but it can sometimes be helpful to Americans to look abroad and understand just how fortunate we are. We rightly bemoan the pernicious weakening of the institutions that protect our liberties in a republic and the bipartisan rise of enthusiastic numbskullism in American politics. But boy do we have it good here. We forget that Brazil, a country of 210 million people with the world’s 8th largest economy, only established its current federal republic in 1988. The guardrails against tyranny are weak to nonexistent. Americans can love, live, work, invest, build and create with confidence because our system is designed to keep men like\xa0Jair Bolsonaro, who are with us in every time, place and society, from becoming our oppressors. We have dallied with authoritarianism several times in our history, but our strong republican institutions have provided us time to think things through and (mostly) return to the wisdom of Mr. Madison’s marvelous machine. But as your fellow native Brazilian\xa0Paulo Coelho\xa0wrote: “Every blessing ignored becomes a curse.” I hope thinking about the plights of less fortunate nations will help us to not ignore our blessings. I will keep your family in my thoughts and prayers. Obrigado e que Deus abençoe.]\xa0\n“Just finished ‘Front Row at the Trump Show’ by\xa0Jonathan Carl, a reporter who has covered Trump for 25 years. It seemed to me to be fairly even-handed and naturally concerned about a free press and preservation of the truth. Carl points out that Trump has always been a ‘serial exaggerator’ and that disregard for the truth comes from both extremes, even in the media. Here’s my question: What is the alternative to Trump in 2020? Joe Biden appears to be the Democratic nominee but what will be more revealing is who he chooses to be his vice-presidential nominee because that person - or an unelected chief of staff - will be in charge. I am a moderate/conservative mid-60’s retired Republican woman. There are very few choices this year (and in general) for someone like me. Further, I am convinced that there are MANY other voters like me on both sides of the aisle.” –\xa0Patricia Chartrand, Coeur d‘Alene, Idaho & Kailua-Kona, Hawaii\n[Ed. note: You’ve really plucked the tightrope Biden is walking with his campaign, Ms. Chartrand. There are lots and lots of Americans like you who might be very pleased to vote for a moderate, caretaker government led by Biden. He could send strong signals to these voters not just with a vice-presidential pick but by surrounding himself with surrogates and advisers who telegraph a message of competency and centrism. But he’s also got a party with a lot of upset radical members who feel that they got stuck with just what they didn’t want: a candidate just like the one who would appeal to moderate Republicans, independents, suburban families, etc. If Biden doesn’t smooch their backsides to a sufficient degree, not only might they stay home, but, more damaging, it would feed a narrative of Democratic disarray that would undercut the very concept of calm competency that Biden would be trying to portray. I’ll spare you my millionth jeremiad against the way our primary system works, but Biden certainly finds himself on a high wire without a net. The challenge for him is to time his pivot from party conciliation to electoral outreach. I haven’t yet finished Jon’s book, but I certainly agree that he’s made a sincere effort to write something balanced and thoughtful.]\n“Your comment in [Monday’s] Halftime Report rang a bell with me. I've long advocated putting our senators and representatives on per diem rather than a salary, the rate being set at a level sufficient to meet ordinary expenses - maybe equal to what federal employees receive when on temporary duty in DC. Couple that with your dormitory and maybe, just maybe, we could get 'em back to what the Founders envisioned:\xa0 citizen legislators who meet to do the public's business, then return home to their real jobs/professions. Yes, I know, there are many for whom this would represent a real hardship, but I can't believe that a salary in the neighborhood of $200K can be justified, given the general lack of productivity demonstrated by our self-anointed aristocracy.” –\xa0Bob Melson,\xa0El Paso, Texas\n[Ed. note: Very interesting, Mr. Melson! But there’s no perfect solution. If subsistence funds were all that the job provided we would doubtless see an increase in the practice in which businesses, public institutions and their influence peddlers provide make-work jobs for members of Congress and their spouses. That’s just one way that lawmakers can legally feather their nests while in office, so it is quite possible to keep a member of Congress on your payroll. But I’ve long ago given up on the idea of ever having an ethically pure legislature. Instead, I think we should focus on efforts toward transparency (full reporting of income, etc.), rules reform (smaller staff, more members, kick out cameras, dorm life) and maybe even a constitutional amendment for term limits. Whatever we do, American voters have a bipartisan interest in rescuing Congress from the hole it has dug for itself in the past 50 years.]\n“A number of years ago, I recommended that Bolling AFB become the required housing for Members of Congress and their families. Fashioning a 3 bedroom, 2 1/2 bath, kitchen, dining room, den and patio, with a security safe office only for the use of the member/senator, from the base housing, barracks and other structures would praise\xa0equality.\xa0\xa0Trams or buses would run round the clock to deliver them to and from work.\xa0The Officers, NCO and enlisted clubs could be transitioned to nice restaurants and bars. The Commissary and Exchange would be transitioned to a reasonable grocery store and shopping plaza.\xa0\xa0The gates would be guarded by capitol police and entry would be restricted to the families, approved staff members and pre-arranged guests. Do I really think any of this will be done. Not in my lifetime, but that does not necessarily make it a bad suggestion.” –\xa0Tom Winter\xa0Lt. Col.

She had trained for five months leading up to the race’s postponement, the first in its 124-year history, and wasn’t ready to wait until the rescheduled date in September to cross the finish line.\xa0She had heard the requests to stay off the 26.2-mile course, but finishing that final stretch down Boylston Street was still on her mind. So, she got creative. …Devers designed a … route that began in the Boston Common and circled through the streets of Back Bay. The circuitous path ended at the marathon’s finish line and would spell, ‘Boston Strong,’ in her app’s GPS. Well, that was the plan at least.

There’s no precise, econometric way to calculate the “three-and-a-half” bills Congress has approved in recent weeks.', 'But, the grand total is pushing $3 trillion. The measures have varied from an initial bill costing $8 billion – which started around $1.2 billion – and exploding to a staggering $2.2 trillion on another. ', 'Now, the real action is set to begin\xa0on Capitol Hill – at least behind the scenes. Democrats already have been calling for more as Republicans try tapping the brakes.', 'This is not your customary “big-spending liberal Democrats” vs. “fiscal conservative Republicans,” but it could emerge as a mutation of those archetypes. Many Republicans long ago ceded any authenticity they may have had when it came\xa0to “limited government” and measured spending. Blazing through cash like this means the era of “big government” arrived, especially if there is a need for expanded government-associated health care. It may come to that if the federal or state governments help\xa0develop enhanced coronavirus testing and contact tracing. We’re talking big money for small businesses, mega money for big businesses, direct payments to Americans idled in their jobs. ', '“There will be a big, broad, bold COVID 4 (bill),” pronounced Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., after the Senate approved the $484 billion interim legislation. “For anyone who thinks this is the last train out of the station, that is not close to the case. And, (House Speaker Nancy Pelosi)\xa0and I will begin rolling up our sleeves and working on that big, broad COVID 4 bill very soon and very quickly.”', 'Uh, not really.', 'That’s not exactly what Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said. But, that’s close to what McConnell was thinking.

Until we begin to open up the economy, we can’t spend enough money to solve the problem.”', 'Colleague Bill Hemmer interviewed McConnell last Wednesday. McConnell indicated then that he had little interest in boosting stressed states and running even more drastic deficits due to the stress of COVID-19. ', '“If we provide additional assistance for state and local governments, it’s only for coronavirus-related matters,” the Kentucky Republican said. “We’re not going to let them take advantage of this pandemic to solve a lot of problems they created for themselves and bad decisions they’ve made in the past.”', 'When McConnell’s office sent out snippets of the majority leader’s remarks on Fox News, aides characterized potential aid to states as “Preventing Blue State Bailouts.”', 'McConnell’s thoughts on states unleashed a fusillade of invective from Democrats.', '“My state subsidizes Sen. McConnell’s state and has for decades,” said Rep. Tom Suozzi, D-N.Y. That’s a reference to how larger states have paid more in federal taxes, even though smaller states like Kentucky have enjoyed the same benefits distributed from Washington.', '“The ‘Grim Reaper’ is telling my states and others to drop dead,” Suozzi continued, invoking McConnell’s self-adopted nickname. “Well, I have a message for you. We’re going to fight you.”', 'Gov. Andrew Cuomo, D-N.Y., had particular contempt for McConnell. ', '“This is one of the really dumb ideas of all time,” Cuomo thundered. “That’s how you’re going to bring this national economy back, by states declaring bankruptcy? You will see a collapse of the national economy.”', 'Cuomo characterized McConnell’s approach as “irresponsible” and “vicious.” ', '“What he’s saying is, if you look at the states that have coronavirus problems, they tend to be Democratic states. New York, California, Michigan, Illinois, they are Democratic states. So, if you fund states that are suffering from the coronavirus, they are Democratic states. Don’t help New York state because it’s a Democratic state. How ugly a thought,” Cuomo charged.', 'House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.,\xa0scolded McConnell.', '“The distinguished leader on the Senate side, Mr. McConnell, said, ‘I think the states should go bankrupt.’ Oh really, and not pay the health-care workers and the hospitals, first responders and the rest? Oh, really? What made you think that was a good idea?” Pelosi questioned.', 'CORONAVIRUS: WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW', 'McConnell’s not the only one dubious about another coronavirus bill. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., has been skeptical\xa0as well. The House and Senate last week just approved $484 billion to amp up aid to small businesses, assist hospitals, develop tests and grant “under-banked” communities access to capital during the pandemic. Small-business aid totaled about $324 billion in the most recent bill. The first tranche of money was $350 billion. Then, the administration urgently came to Congress with a request for $251 billion after the Small Business Administration tore through that cash in a matter of weeks. Nobody seemed to be sure if small businesses would need more fast cash.', '“Think about how much we have passed already. This is over a $400 billion bill. The one before it was more than $2 trillion. We should have all of that implemented and working before we look to pass something else,” McCarthy said.', 'Rep. Ralph Norman, R-S.C., argued lawmakers incinerated too much cash already.', '“What we’ve got to do now is figure out how to pay for this,” Norman said. “Congress ought to be up here working on how we’re going to pay this back. $2.4 trillion is not just going to magically appear. We didn’t get this money from a savings account that the country had saved up. It’s borrowed money.”', 'It’s unclear which side will prevail. But, many Republicans already have been trying to slow the spending snowslide to avert utter economic catastrophe. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky.,\xa0suggested that re-opening the country could choke the spending spree.', '“The question before us isn’t ‘do nothing’ or ‘print endless amounts of bailout cash,’” Paul said. “It is not a lack of money that plagues, but a lack of commerce.”', 'That’s why lawmakers have been torn. It’s great if states and localities are able to re-open safely, which would diminish dependence on the federal government. But, even if communities did open back up, will people eat and shop? Are they confident enough in their own economic situation to spend money? Is it safe to do so? Or, would coronavirus then race through a community, requiring even more aid from Washington? ', 'The stark reality: The concept of “fiscal responsibility” went out the window long ago. The federal debt grew geometrically under President Trump. Former House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., professed to be one of the most stalwart fiscal conservatives in a generation. But, spending and deficits went up under his watch, too. Numerous Republicans over the years have approved expanded debt.', '“Republicans want to spend more money on the military. The Democrats want to spend more money on social programs. And they make this deal with the devil where they both engage in deficit spending,” said Rep. Ken Buck, R-Colo.', 'Maybe this is why the\xa0debate really has been only about Republicans vs. Democrats. Republicans denounced Democrats for delaying a GOP request for an additional $251 billion for small businesses. That figure represented one-fifth of what Congress has allocated each year to run the federal government, but when it came\xa0to the Democrats’\xa0asks, Republicans haven’t been as interested.', 'On Fox News, Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., argued in favor of a fourth coronavirus bill, but denounced the Democrats’ requests.', '“Democrats have their wish list out, (a) long\xa0laundry list of their projects. We don’t need any of that,” Hawley said.', 'Regardless, the problem has been that the rate of federal spending could outpace the nation’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Such an inversion would really hamper the ability of the economy to grow once the pandemic would subside.', 'Last year’s annual federal deficit clocked in at just under $1 trillion. The deficit for this year could quadruple to nearly $4 trillion. That would hike the overall national debt to more than $27 trillion. ', 'CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP', 'It’s unclear whether the sides will find enough common ground to implement another coronavirus bill. But, spending close to $3 trillion in a matter of weeks has been staggering. There may be races to reopen sectors of the economy to stem the federal spending explosion.

Mr. Vice President, welcome back to ""FOX News Sunday"". \xa0MIKE PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Morning, Chris. \xa0WALLACE: I want to start with those growing protests across the country against the stay-at-home orders. Some of the protestors ignoring social distancing. What do you think, specifically, of their protests and how they\'re carrying them out? \xa0PENCE: Well, first let me say from the moment President Trump asked me to lead the White House Coronavirus Task Force two months ago he made it clear that we had one objective and that was to save lives. And in the intervening two months the American people have stepped forward, have embraced the social distancing, have done the mitigation efforts. And as we sit here this morning we continue to see encouraging results, declining cases, declining hospitalizations, because of what the American people have done, because of the president\'s leadership and what governors have done around the country. We are slowing the spread, we\'re hastening the day, when we can put the coronavirus in the past and re-open the American economy. \xa0Beyond the focus on lives, the president also made it clear that we wanted to ensure that our hospital workers, incredible men and women, had the resources and equipment that they needed. We\'ve sent hundreds of millions of medical supplies to the critical areas around the country. And I must tell you the fact that no American who has needed a ventilator has been denied a ventilator. It\'s a great testament to our national response at every level. \xa0And on the subject of testing, we\'re continuing to scale and expand testing and will do that because as the president laid out those guidelines this week -- no one wants to re-open America more than President Donald Trump. And what you see, I think, among millions of Americans who have been embracing those social distancing measures and making the sacrifices is they want their governors to find a way to responsibly and safely re-open their state economies. And what the president laid out last week is a framework -- a phased framework to re-open America, to do that, and we\'re going to work very closely with governors to implement that as soon as we can responsibly -- \xa0WALLACE: Vice President -- \xa0PENCE: -- do it around the country (ph). \xa0WALLACE: -- it -- but, Mr. Vice President, in a number of these cases these protestors, who are not social distancing, are saying they don\'t want to wait. In many cases they\'re protesting your own guidelines to stop the spread. \xa0On Friday the president tweeted this, and I want to put it up, ""Liberate Minnesota!"", ""Liberate Michigan!"", and ""Liberate Virginia, and save your great 2nd Amendment. It is under siege!"" Washington Governor Inslee responded ""The president is fomenting domestic rebellion and spreading lies even while his own administration says the virus is real and deadly."" \xa0So what does the president mean -- because you\'ve got guidelines that are calling for social distancing and staying at home. Even your new guidelines to re-open the country are very phased and gradual. What does the president mean when he says liberate these states? \xa0PENCE: The American people know that no one in America wants to re-open this country more than President Donald Trump. And on Thursday the president directed us to lay out guidelines for when and how states could responsibly do that. And in the president\'s tweets and public statements, I can assure you, he\'s going to continue to encourage governors to find ways to safely and responsibly let America go back to work. \xa0And the guidelines for opening up America again give a roadmap for doing just that, Chris. For states that have 14 days of consecutive declining cases, that have proper hospitalization capacity, we recommend that they -- \xa0WALLACE: Right. \xa0PENCE: -- can begin under phase one to ease the social distancing measures that have been put into effect, allow some people to begin to come back to work, allow some activities in the community to begin to happen. And when the president speaks about re-opening America it\'s all about encouraging governors, as soon as they determine as most proper and most appropriate to be able to do that and do that quickly. \xa0America works when America -- \xa0WALLACE: Mr. Vice President -- \xa0PENCE: -- is working and the president wants to see us put the coronavirus in the past by these strong measures the American people have embraced. But we want to get America working again, just as soon as we can. \xa0WALLACE: Understood, Mr. Vice President. I want to talk to you about your plan to re-open the country, because there are a number of health experts that say that we need triple the number of tests that are now being conducted and much more contact tracing in order to safely re-open the government. Can you tell us that -- how soon that you\'re going to have 500,000 tests a day, which is what they\'re calling for -- we\'re doing about 150,000 now. How soon are we going to have 500,000 tests a day? Or don\'t you think that\'s necessary? \xa0PENCE: Well under the guidelines for opening up America again, we create, in phase one, a specific criteria for testing that we believe is appropriate to be able to test people that have symptoms with (ph) coronavirus and be able to monitor people that are particularly vulnerable to serious outcomes, nursing homes and particular populations in our cities that have shown some vulnerability. \xa0That\'s -- we believe the testing that we have today, Chris, across the country, once we activate all of the labs that can do coronavirus testing, is sufficient for any state in America to move into phase one. We\'re doing about 150,000 tests a day. And you remember a month ago we had done 80,000 tests total. Now we\'ve cleared 4 million overall. But at 150,000 tests a day -- we think we can double that number by working with governors to activate all of the laboratories in their states around the country that can do coronavirus testing, that would put us at roughly 300,000. \xa0But what we\'re going to make clear to governors, again tomorrow in our weekly conference call -- and I want to make clear to the American people, is that President Trump\'s direction -- we\'re going to continue to fully partner with governors around the country and health officials in increasing and scaling the amount of testing. And we have every confidence that we can have a sufficient amount of testing to be able to re-open America, not just in phase one, but continue in the weeks and months ahead to expand testing in ways that will give the American people the confidence and the tools to be able to go back to work. \xa0WALLACE: Mr. Vice President, I\'ve got limited time with you so I\'m going to try to squeeze a few more questions in. The $350 billion program to provide loans to small businesses has run out and you still don\'t have a deal on replenishing that with another $250 billion. How close are you to a deal with the Democrats? \xa0PENCE: The Paycheck Protection Program that the president signed into law has been an incredible success and literally has made it possible for small businesses around America to keep people on the payroll over a two month period of time while we weather the storm of the coronavirus. But as the president and I were literally on a phone call with Republicans and Democrats last week, we learned that the fund had run out and we are urging Democrats in the House and the Senate to step forward and approve an expansion of the Paycheck Protection Bill. We\'re close Chris -- \xa0WALLACE: So briefly -- \xa0PENCE: -- we\'re encouraged -- \xa0WALLACE: -- how close are you to it sir? \xa0PENCE: The negotiations are going on. We\'re very close but I think every American has seen the success of the president\'s program to provide payroll support and we\'re going to work to expand that so that no one working in a small business in America would have to worry about missing a paycheck during the trial and difficulty of the coronavirus epidemic. \xa0WALLACE: Several sources now say that the coronavirus originated in a lab in Wuhan and that the Chinese government covered it up for some period of time which allowed the virus to spread. Now Speaker Pelosi says while the president imposed his travel ban in January he didn\'t -- he minimized the threat from the virus. Here she is sir. \xa0(BEGIN CLIP) \xa0REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA), SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES: Instead of calling it a hoax, instead of calling it a -- minimizing and say it (ph) was magically disappeared. We lost time in delaying and the denial caused deaths and that\'s just the way it is. \xa0(END CLIP) \xa0WALLACE: Mr. Vice President, I\'m getting this question a lot, and again I\'ve got to ask you for a brief answer. What specifically is this administration going to do to hold China accountable? \xa0PENCE: Well I appreciate you referencing the fact that by the end of January of this year, President Trump took the unprecedented step of suspending all travel from China. No American president had ever done that. And there\'s no question all of our health experts agree that that bought us an invaluable amount of time to -- it\'s enabled us to save lives and make sure healthcare workers have the resources that they need to meet this moment. \xa0But it is clear to us that not only was there a failure by the World Health Organization to communicate to America and the world what was happening in China, but also that China was not as forthcoming as they should have been with America or the world about what was happening -- \xa0WALLACE: So are we going -- \xa0(CROSSTALK) \xa0PENCE: Well the president\'s made it clear he\'s not happy. He -- we\'re going to make proper inquiries into this at the proper time. But, I have to tell you, the one mission that this president has given the White House Coronavirus Task Force is to save lives, to put this coronavirus in the past. We\'re going to stay focused on that mission. It\'s one mission and one team. We\'re going to work with governors across the country in both political parties. \xa0And I just want the American people to be encouraged by the fact that we are making progress. We really do see downward trends in cases and in -- \xa0WALLACE: Right. \xa0PENCE: -- hospitalizations and we really believe that because of what the American people have done, because of our incredible healthcare workers, that we are together as a nation hastening the day when we will put the coronavirus in the past and get America working again. \xa0WALLACE: Vice President Pence, thank you. Thanks for your time during a very busy period. Please come back, sir. \xa0PENCE: Thank you, Chris. ', ""WALLACE: As we said, the relief program meant to support small businesses run dry and leaders in Congress and the White House can't agree on how to replenish it.

', ""Karl, what do you think of the president's plan, as announced this week, to reopen the economy and what about the concern that we don't have enough testing and contact tracing to do it? "", ""KARL ROVE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Yes. Well, first of all, this fame -- it's not really a plan, it's a framework, a road map. I thought it was very well-crafted. It shows the president recognizing the differences between states and even the differences inside states. It recognizes the primacy of governors and mayors in executing this, making these decisions. It relies clearly upon health experts and being drafted. "", ""Contrary to what Speaker Pelosi said, this is clearly got the fingerprints of Dr. Fauci, Dr. Birx all over it. I'm glad that's the case. And it depends ultimately on three things, lots of testing, which unlike -- you know, Nancy Pelosi seems to think you can just click your fingers and there's going to be plenty of tests. It's difficult, having been in the White House when we were at SARS and MERS -- or, excuse me, in H5N1, the testing that has to be done for this are -- is difficult to organize, difficult to create, difficult to -- to validate, but it's being done. "", ""It also requires that we continue our social distancing practices and it's going to require a lot of prudent common sense steps by businesses as they begin to bring back employees and customers. So I think it's a good, excellent road map. It's going to take some time. We're going to have to be -- we're going to have to be willing to accept that. Even if a state does - - meets all of these thresholds for all three phases -- "", 'WALLACE: Right. ', ""ROVE: We're talking about six weeks before we can get areas of the country back to anything that looks sort of normal. "", ""WALLACE: Marie, a number of Democratic officials are saying that the president is moving too fast, but to pick up on Karl's point, isn't that a hard case to make when this plan has been endorsed by Dr. Fauci, the kind of unchallenged expert on all this, and especially when you see growing restiveness and frustration with the stay-at-home orders and the economic consequences of that? "", ""MARIE HARF, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: There are a number of independent medical experts who have been very clear publicly that we do not have enough testing yet. And that until we do, pushing to reopen to early will just result in more outbreaks in places we thought we had it contained. So when you see some of these protests that you talked to your previous guests about in places like Michigan, in places like Ohio, they're not social distancing. They are promoting reopening the economy while ignoring all of these national guidelines. And so each of these governors have huge responsibilities right now to -- to message to their citizens in a way that convinces them that these are in place for their own good, to help protect them and their families. "", ""But the bottom line, Chris, is that there are very few indices in this country that can actually get the number of tests we need, that can bring together industry, that can use the Defense Production Act to get the tests we need, which right now have plateaued. And that's the federal government. So that's one place we actually do need a little more action, is getting more testing and getting industry around doing that.

"", '(END VIDEO CLIP) ', ""WALLACE: Bret, the president often ended up in a less controversial place, like when he eventually said, it's up to governors to open up their own states at the pace they choose. But he sometimes took a circuitous route to get there. "", ""BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS CHIEF POLITICAL ANCHOR: Chris, you know, I covered and wrote about President Eisenhower, the 34th president, and he used to say, words matter and less is more. The 45th president takes a much different communication style. He thinks more is more, as evidenced by these press briefings. And his supporters will tell you that words matter less if -- I said last week, if President Obama had said that he had total authority to tell the states when to open that conservatives heads would have exploded. Well, two days later, when the president said the governors will make the call, if Obama had done that turnabout, conservatives' heads would have exploded too. "", ""But the bottom line is that it's the actions and it's Dr. Birx and Dr. Fauci and Dr. Redfield up on that podium with the president signing off on this, not flicking the switch, but nuanced rollout of guidelines for states. So it's the actions, not the words, his supporters will tell you. But, clearly, the communications style frustrates a lot of people and maybe independents. "", ""WALLACE: Karl, let me pick up on that because there's no question, when the president says he has the authority, total authority, to decide to open up states or when he talks about liberating Minnesota, it creates a controversy. But, in the end, to Bret's point, does that really matter, or is the -- is the real importance here going to be where we end up, both in a public health sense and in an economic sense? "", ""ROVE: I think that's right. It's going to be what's the result of this? Do we think that, at the end of this, that the American people think, look, we came through this thing about as well as could be expected? Nobody's got a sense that everything has to be perfect. Nobody has the sense that, oh, you know, we -- we -- we don't have enough testing and we can solve that problem tomorrow by invoking the -- the Defense Production Act. There's no need to do that because every business, every pharmaceutical company, every testing company that wants to be involved and can be involved is involved in this. "", ""But, you're right, at the end of the day it's going to be, what are the end results of this. "", ""WALLACE: Yes. And, look, it's governed by these -- you know, the Stafford Act, the, you know, Public Health Emergency Act, the Disaster Act of 1974, and clearly every one of those acts, to some degree, looks for a balance in our federalist system between the president and the -- and the -- and the federal government and states and local governments. And some there are more authorities for states and -- and -- and some more for the federal government. "", 'But we live in a federalist system and they got to -- they got to deal with that.

', ""BAIER: One hundred percent. I think it's the election. And I'll quote a -- a very well-known anchor who said just that about a week and a half ago, Chris Wallace. I think it comes down to how we get out of it and how the president handles this. But, you know, you put on the intro there the China part. And I think that's going to be a big part of the election, how China is used, not only -- and you can see this by the Biden campaign putting out a foreign policy advisor, Tony Blinken, pointing to President Trump's comments about China being positive. "", 'But there are about 80 percent, according to the internal polls cited by ""The New York Times,"" of the public who believe that China really covered up at the beginning. U.S. officials are convinced that\'s the case. It\'s not conclusive that it came from this lab accidentally or otherwise yet, but they are convinced that China really covered up at the beginning and that\'s going to be a big focus of this. ', 'The fascinating part, Chris, was the question to Nancy Pelosi about her walk in Chinatown on February 24th. February 19th, there was a Democratic debate in Las Vegas. Three words weren\'t sad, ""virus,"" ""coronavirus,"" or ""Covid-19."" Never came up. ', 'WALLACE: Well, to throw a bouquet back at you, obviously, China becoming a bigger issue after your reporting this week about, as some sources told you, the biggest political cover-up in history by China about its role in the virus. ', 'Karl, let me switch subjects to you. ', ""Joe Biden, there's asymmetric warfare here because Joe Biden is stuck in the basement TV studio in his home in Delaware. If you were advising him, how would you tell him to try to strike a higher profile, or would you say that's a mistake at this point. Look, everybody's focused on the virus, just let the stage to the president. "", ""ROVE: Well, you've got to recognize there are limitations because, you're right, the president dominates this. This is a time where no matter what he does, he's going to -- Biden is not going to have the profile of the president. "", ""I would say three things. First of all, don't pick a -- don't pick a fight over China. If the question of this election is, who's tougher on China, Donald Trump is the answer, not Joe Biden. "", ""Second of all, I would not follow the practice of Nancy Pelosi, which Joe Biden is, unfortunately, following, and that is just to pick at the administration and say defense -- you're not using the Defense Production Act. Da, da, da. Da, da, da. Da, da, da. That's -- you know, look, he's quickly and she's quickly becoming what Bill Sapphire (ph) once called nattering nabobs of negativism. "", 'To me, one of the things that would be important is for Joe Biden to -- if he wants to contrast with the president, to herald the actions of these Democratic governors, like Cuomo and Newsom and others, who are getting very high marks in their states for managing this well. ', ""And, thirdly, the third piece is, I would be focused on what it is that would be necessary to convince people in the fall that Joe Biden ought to replace Donald Trump. And that's not the moment of the immediate controversy. It's sharing a broader and bigger vision as a traditional Democrat. And he ain't doing that. He is going -- continuing to go hard -- march hard to the left. And I think if he keeps doing that, by the time we get to August and September, those small group of swing voters are going to -- are going to be forced with the issue, do I want to keep Donald Trump in office after I voted Democrat for Congress in 2018, or do I want to go with a guy who seems to see -- seems to be like Bernie Sanders only not so much Bernie Sanders? I mean that's not a particularly good choice to -- for those independents to make if you're Joe Biden. "", ""WALLACE: All right, let -- I've heard from the Republican strategist about what Joe Biden should do. Let's hear now from the Democratic strategist about what Joe Biden should do. He's -- he's obviously -- doesn't have the platform the president has. How critical should he be and how much should he try to struggle for a stage and attention he's just not going to get it at point? "", ""HARF: President Trump's platform is a little bit of a double-edged sword though because he does have the power of the bully pulpit and the White House Briefing Room every single day. But some of the things he's said are literally writing their own attack ads. When President Trump stood up there and said, I take no responsibility, when he promised we would all be able to get a test if we wanted one. Donald Trump talks a lot, as Bret mentioned earlier, and -- and those are writing their own ads for the Democrats right now. "", ""Joe Biden's whole theory of the case has been a return to normalcy and competence. That was before the crisis. That was his theory for why he should be the nominee and why he can beat Donald Trump. That is even more of his theory of the case now that he is running a someone who can bring normalcy back to this country and confidence back. And overwhelmingly polling shows that's what people want -- people want in this election. And, you know, he will continue doing cable, Chris. He will continue doing virtual fundraisers. But that fundamental question come November is where Joe Biden thinks he can bring Democrats and independents and some disaffected Republicans along with him. "", ""WALLACE: Bret, to Marie's point, the White House Briefing Room can be a double-edged sword. As we've seen some cases it shows the president in charge. I -- I think it's fair to say that the rollout of the phases and the gating that was -- you know, the very gradual reopening of the country was well received on Thursday. But some of the things the president has said over the last couple of weeks have gotten him in trouble. And, in fact, you've seen a bit of a dip in public approval for the president, even with these long national briefings. "", ""BAIER: Well, that's true. And there are all kinds of different, you know, questions that -- of all different flavors that come up and sometimes the president is out there longer than his supporters and aides would like him to be. But he's running this show. And it just -- how we get out of it -- most importantly how the economy recovers. Twenty-two million Americans filing for unemployment. Small businesses, one in four saying they're teetering on closing or closing. This is massive. It's a nuclear bomb in the U.S. economy. "", ""So there's the health side, but the economic side is as important of how we crawl out of this. "", 'WALLACE: And when you talk about people wanting those briefings to be shorter, as the anchor of ""SPECIAL REPORT,"" which is usually on at 6:00 p.m. Eastern, when the briefings are happening, I suspect sometimes you\'re looking at your watch. ', ""BAIER: We're -- we're ready either way. We're ready either way. Last -- yesterday -- or I -- the other day I had 22 minutes. So that was great.

"", 'WALLACE: But that quick bounce back that you talk about goes against the forecast of most experts. Take a look at these numbers sir.

So all these models are based upon health assumptions, how quickly we reopen, so we'll see. My own opinion is, again, we have unprecedented amount of liquidity in the system. We're very sympathetic to all the people that are out of work. But there is enhanced unemployment, there's the PPP, there's direct deposits. This is going to put (ph) a lot of liquidity. And as businesses begin to open you're going to see demand side of the economy rebound. "", ""WALLACE: Let's talk about the PPP. The president just signed a bill that Congress had passed, another $310 billion for the Paycheck Protection Program. But the first round, I think it was $250/$300 billion, the sign-up for that ran out in 13 days. How long do you think this next tranche of $310 billion is going to last? And can you guarantee that big corporations, for instance like Ruth's Chris that got money the first time around, eventually pay it back, but did get money won't even get money this time? "", 'MNUCHIN: Chris I just want to put this in perspective -- and I want to thank everybody at the SBA and the Treasury because we launched a brand new program and in an incredibly short period of time. And the fact that we ran out of money just goes to show the success of this. ', ""Now let me put this in perspective, in the first round over a million companies had workers of 10 people or below. And there has been a lot of focus on these bigger companies, public companies. We came out with new guidelines. We made it clear they shouldn't have applied. They're paying back the money. So I think you're going to see this move in the right direction and I think you're going to also see in this round the average loan size go down significantly. "", 'WALLACE: But to my other question which was that the money for the first program lasted less than two weeks. How long do you expect this money to last? ', ""MNUCHIN: Chris to me it's not a matter of how long it lasts, the -- actually I think the sooner the money is dispersed the better. So the first round impacted about 30 million workers. I think this round will be about the same. That will be close to 50 percent of the private workforce. So I actually hope we run out of money quickly so we can get the money into the workers' pockets. And, again, in this round we're making it clear that small businesses have access. We've signed up a lot of CDFIs. We're signing up more of them. So we're going to make sure that this is distributed fairly. "", ""WALLACE: Congress is already talking, with all the money that's already been dispersed, it's talking about yet another relief bill. And one of the big issues there is whether or not to give $500 billion in relief to state and local governments so that they can continue to pay first responders and other workers and to provide services.

The bill first passed 96 to O (ph) and this one was unanimous consent in the Senate. So my comment on this is, this will be something that both the Senate and the House debate. It will be something that we discuss on a bipartisan basis. ', ""The president has heard from governors. He wants to speak to governors. This is something we'll consider. But our focus right now is really on execution and -- that's what we're focused on and if we need more money -- as I've said, this is a war. We'll win this war, if we need to spend more money we will, and we'll only do it with bipartisan support. "", ""WALLACE: All right. Let me pick up on that last point because with all of the money that's already gone out, the national debt will, by the end of this year, exceed the gross domestic product, the total output of the economy, it will be over 100 percent of GDP which has always been considered a kind of redline for stable economies. How much do you worry about a debt in excess of 100 percent of GDP? "", ""MNUCHIN: Well, Chris, the good news is that interest rates are extremely low. So if you look at the portion of the budget that we're actually allocating to interest it's extremely low and we're locking in long term rates to make sure this additional money we've locked up for a long period of time. Overtime that is something we're going to need to look at and we're going to need to look at overtime how we deal with that issue. But right now we're in a war and we have to protect American workers and American business. And we're going to do whatever we need to take to do that. "", ""WALLACE: In the time we have left, I'd like to do a lightening round. I've done these with you before, quick questions, quick answers. We see states starting to reopen.

', 'And now that we see the number of deaths over 53,000, almost 54,000 this morning, can you give us a sense of the range, of how many deaths we may see from this virus overall, depending on how careful we are in the -- in the reopening? ', 'INGLESBY: Yes. I would say that we are, you know, for lack of better words, maybe near the end of the beginning of this pandemic in this country. We have reached a plateau nationally at this point. ', ""I mean, trends can change over time, but at this point we have a plateau in new cases per day. Unfortunately, it's a very high plateau. We still are seeing about 30,000 new cases of COVID-19 every day in the United States and still are seeing something on the order of 2,000 deaths per day. "", 'So we are not through -- out of the woods by any means, in terms of this pandemic, but at least we have reached a kind of a stable number of new infections and the number of people who are dying from this illness. ', 'WALLACE: If you -- ', 'INGLESBY: And one last point on that -- ', 'WALLACE: And you know -- ', '(CROSSTALK) ', ""WALLACE: Let me just say, at one point we were talking about models, 1 million people; then it was 100,000 people; then it was 60,000. Now we're already up to 53,000. So give me a sense of the number -- I understand these are -- these are predictions, but the number of fatalities we might see from this. "", 'INGLESBY: So I think modelers are pretty reluctant to model way beyond a month or two out from now because of so many variables. If we change our social distancing policies and depending on how well states get prepared for the easing into the reopening, that could change outcomes quite a bit. ', ""But the leading models at the moment protect anywhere from 58,000 deaths to 110,000 deaths in the next month in the united states. I think no one is really modeling beyond that. And really, it's going to depend on many things that are difficult to wrap up into a single number. "", ""WALLACE: All right. Let me ask you one more question, trying to foresee the future. Vice President Pence gave a timeline this week for when we're going to come out of this. "", 'Here he is. ', '(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ', 'VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE: If you look at the trends today that -- I think by Memorial Day weekend we will largely have this coronavirus epidemic behind us. ', '(END VIDEO CLIP) ', 'WALLACE: Memorial Day weekend, Doctor -- is that realistic? ', 'INGLESBY: Well, at this point, if you go state by state, you see that about half of the country -- in half of the country, the numbers are still rising day to day. And about another third of the country, there seems to be a leveling off. And only a minority -- in a minority of the country the numbers are actually coming down day by day. ', ""And so I -- I don't think it's likely that we will be at that position by Memorial Day, but even more importantly, wherever we are in the epidemic, this virus is going to be with us until we have a vaccine. "", ""So as we ease up on social distancing measures and economies begin to very carefully reopen, we are at risk of recurrence or re-spikes in the illness in the epidemic. So I think everyone needs to be aware that, even as we're beginning to open up again, there is a -- a clear chance of a rise in cases in states that are doing that. "", ""WALLACE: Let -- let's talk about that, because a number of states, as you know, are beginning to reopen spas, salons, gyms, even restaurants. "", ""Is that safe for people -- you know, you talk about a spot where people are giving massages, a salon where people are filing people's nails are cutting their hair. Is that safe for people to be that close, at this point, if they're wearing masks and gloves? "", ""INGLESBY: I don't think it's going to be possible for anyone to say something is safe, you know, completely safe at this point. Because the virus is very transmissible between people and because some people don't have symptoms, at least -- either in the beginning of the illness or maybe even at all during their illness. "", ""But we can say some things are safer than others, and businesses that have small numbers of people are probably safer than businesses that have very large numbers of people. And the closeness of the interaction, that also is a factor. So if people are going to be closely interacting, they should be using personal protective equipment if that's available in their state. And outdoors will be safer than indoors. "", ""So there is a range of different -- there are going to be a range of different risks that businesses face, and it's important for all businesses now to be trying to understand their risks and making plans for how to diminish the risks as best they can within their own business and their own operations. "", 'WALLACE: Let -- let me ask you a quick, direct question. Would you feel safe at this point getting a haircut, getting a massage, if you and the person doing it were both wearing gloves and masks? ', ""INGLESBY: I think, at this point, in most places in the country, with the rate of illness as it is, I -- I don't think so. There may be some places where community -- community transmission is so low and testing is so good that we have confidence that the risk is low. But I'd say I would be cautious about doing that at this point. "", 'WALLACE: You talk about testing. I know one of the problems you have with the White House guidelines is that you think they failed to address the issues of testing and contact tracing. Here is President Trump on that this week. ', '(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ', ""PRESIDENT DONALD J. TRUMP: We're doing very well on testing. We've tested far more than anybody else anywhere in the world. "", '(inaudible), go ahead. ', ""QUESTION: Do you agree with Dr. Fauci that we're just not there yet? "", ""TRUMP: No, I don't agree with him on that. No, I think we're doing a great job on testing. "", '(END VIDEO CLIP) ', ""WALLACE: We're averaging -- averaging about 150,000 tests a day. Isn't that enough? "", ""INGLESBY: No, it's not enough. And the reason why is because we're not testing a lot of the mild and moderate illness that isn't -- people who aren't sick enough to be in the hospital. And so all those people are not getting counted and they aren't necessarily having their contacts traced or told to isolate in their own homes. So we're missing a lot of the illness in the country. "", ""Until we get that under control, we're going to continue to have lines of transmission that we can't see. And beyond that, many businesses are now really beginning to think about how diagnostics might factor into their reopening plans. And we just don't have diagnostic testing available on large scale for businesses. "", ""We're still focused on diagnosing the sickest people, those in nursing homes, health care workers, which is completely appropriate, but they're a small fraction of the number of people that we're going to need to test to really find all the illness and to get the economy moving in the right direction again. "", 'WALLACE: I want to squeeze two more questions in here in the time we have left, Doctor. ', 'I want to ask you about another White House guideline, and that is a steady decline in the number of new cases over the course of two weeks. I want to put some stats on the screen. ', 'Oklahoma is coming down from its peak but had a 26 percent increase in new cases in the last week. And it went, over the course of the last week -- the numbers jumped from a low of 29 new cases last Sunday to over 100 new cases just this past Thursday and Friday. ', 'Should a state with those kinds of numbers be reopening now? ', ""INGLESBY: You know, I would be very cautious about doing that. I think we've seen -- there's an example in the papers this morning about a state in Japan that reopened quickly in March after a few weeks of low-ish numbers and three weeks later rebounded to the point where they have to now close their economy down again. "", ""So I think it's going to be important to really go slowly. For those states who do reopen, I think it should be done very carefully with a lot of monitoring of both hospitalization rate, ICU rate, death rates. "", 'So at this point only about five states in the country, to my count, have had two weeks of decline, so only about two weeks in the -- two states -- or five states, rather, in the country, have met the gating criteria laid out by the White House. ', ""WALLACE: I've got about a minute left for one final question. As you know, President Trump -- "", 'INGLESBY: Yeah. ', 'WALLACE: -- has come under fire over the last week or so, first for advocating the use of hydroxychloroquine and then later this week -- this week -- for talking about the possibility, speculating about the possibility of injecting disinfectant. ', 'Here he is on that. ', '(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ', 'TRUMP: I see the disinfectant knocks it out in a minute, one minute. And is there a way we can do something like that by injection inside or -- or almost a cleaning? ', '(END VIDEO CLIP) ', ""WALLACE: I know you want to stay away from politics, and I think it's clear that any kind of ingestion of a disinfectant is dangerous. But two quick questions. "", 'One, where are you at this point about the use of hydroxychloroquine? ', 'And two, how do we sort through all of the conflicting advice that we get? ', 'INGLESBY: Well, to your first question, I think the -- there needs to be more study of hydroxychloroquine. Two studies that have come out so far have suggested it is possibly more harmful than helpful and possibly dangerous. ', ""So I don't think anyone should be taking hydroxychloroquine unless they are in a randomized controlled trial that's being carefully studied. "", 'And the second point is that I think the -- the most important thing now in terms of medicines and vaccines is to follow where medical leaders and scientific leaders guide us. They are doing the studies. These studies take time. These medicines can actually hurt people. So there is a harm that could potentially -- ', 'WALLACE: Right. ', ""INGLESBY: -- happen if people take medicines that aren't studied. So it's important to follow scientists. "", 'WALLACE: Dr. Inglesby, thank you.

', ""You have to go back and think about why we closed down in the first place. You know, I've issued 15 executive orders since March 15th, when I first declared the state of emergency, but it was but to build capacity in our hospitals, to make sure we didn't over run our health care system, it was to build supply for PPE and it was to flatten the curve.

"", ""WALLACE: But, Governor, here is the head of your state -- your state medical association, Dr. George Monks. Let's put up his comments on the screen. Even without widespread testing, Oklahoma has seen an ongoing growth in the number of cases, hospitalizations and deaths in the past week alone. "", 'He points out the White House guidelines call for a two-week downward trajectory in cases and says, we are far from this point. ', 'Governor, that is the head of your state medical association. ', ""STITT: Well, I -- I don't know exactly who that is, but the department of health head in our state is Gary Cox, and we have followed all of the White House guidelines. There were four gates that we've met. And the facts are, we have been on a steady decline since March 30th in hospitalizations and we have 300 across our state. And that's when we decided to have a measured reopening. "", ""We're always going to be data driven in Oklahoma. We're watching it. We -- I have put up 80 different mobile test sites across the state. We currently ranked 25th in the nation in number of testing. And it is time for a measured reopening. But I also told Oklahomans that we'll be data driven. We'll continue to watch the trends. And if the percentage of tests start increasing or hospitalizations start increasing, that we'll kick back one of those phases and we can obviously reserve the rights to back up if we need to. But we believe it's the time to have a measured reopening. "", 'WALLACE: Well, in fact, the reopening started two days ago when under your order spas and nail salons and barbershops could reopen. ', 'Do you have any sense of how many in fact did reopen on Friday? ', ""STITT: Well, you've got to realize that -- and I gave that -- you know, certain communities could start with a phase one yesterday on the 24th or two days ago on the 24th by appointment only. These are barbershops. These are folks like in Midwest City that have been in business for 50 years. "", ""And next Friday, on May 1st, is when where going to have a limited reopening for churches, if they -- if they follow social distancing and have every other pew, some in restaurant dining, we're going to spread the tables out six feet apart, mask up, do temperature testing. So we have a list of guidance for those restaurants that want to start opening. And, again, we're going to be data-driven. But I'm -- I'm -- we will not make decisions in Oklahoma, what we're seeing on television or what we're seeing happening in other states.

We're -- people are still going to get it. But Oklahomans are safe and -- and -- and we're ready for a measured reopening. "", ""WALLACE: Well, I want to ask you about -- about the measured reopening. There's nobody who wants to reopen a country more than President Trump.

The idea that a vaccine is going to come within the next few months as opposed to 12 to 18 or even more.

Like everyone else, I'm just trying to make sense of the evolving information."", ""Many of us have been monitoring the daily reports measuring the number of deaths relative to the number of cases. We've been treated to crash courses in lay epidemiology via daily press briefings and voluminous articles."", 'We understand that the administration and state governments have been trying to ""flatten the curve"" of the coronavirus by slowing its spread. The main purpose, as has now been clarified, is to reduce the velocity of the contagion so that our hospitals and necessary equipment are not overwhelmed, which would result in more deaths.', ""NEWT GINGRICH: WE CAN RETURN TO A PRE-CORONAVIRUS ECONOMY\xa0– HERE'S HOW\xa0"", ""Though many didn't grasp this initially, flattening the curve doesn't greatly reduce the overall number of deaths, except for those saved by reducing the burden on hospitals and others saved by lifesaving therapeutic treatments and vaccines developed with the extra time flattening provides."", 'Many have suggested that the estimated death rates have been grossly overstated because the numerator (number of deaths) has been exaggerated and the denominator (number of people infected) has been understated.', 'CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER', 'They say the numerator was inflated because many deaths actually caused by the flu were attributed to COVID-19, and because every death of a person with the virus in their system was treated as a death caused by the virus even though some other accompanying illness may have been the proximate cause.', ""The denominator was likely understated because so many people had the disease before we were aware it was circulating here; many were asymptomatic and never got tested; and many who were symptomatic assumed they had the flu. Several recent studies have confirmed, through randomized antibody testing, that in certain locations, exponentially more people were infected than we'd assumed."", ""Stanford University researchers found that Santa Clara County in California had between 50 and 80 times more infections than officials were reporting. A separate antibody study showed that the number of coronavirus infections in Los Angeles County could be 28 to 55 times higher than the official count. A just-released study estimates that some 2.7 million New Yorkers may have been infected – more than 10 times the state's confirmed cases to date."", ""Obviously, we'll know more when antibody testing is conducted throughout the country. But these tests strongly indicate that the virus is less lethal by orders of magnitude than previously known."", ""Many argue that this emerging data proves we overreacted by shutting down our economy and wreaking such financial devastation. If we knew in December what we think we know now, this may have been true. Until comprehensive testing is performed and the data analyzed, however, we won't be sure of the virus' lethality. I suspect it will be more than that of the flu. If it is as contagious as we fear, we might think twice before making final judgments as to what should or shouldn't have been done."", ""I think the critics' skepticism is based on their distrust of other experts who have ginned up fear over apocalyptic climate change based on computer models. Knowing how much disinformation those experts have spread, people are justifiably suspicious of what now appear to be wildly erroneous coronavirus models that scared the world into a global economic shutdown."", 'People are still debating whether these initial models factored in mitigation measures, but we can certainly fault modelers for their absolutism and arrogance, and we can use this experience to challenge the credibility of climate change modelers on their projections.', ""We have to be prudent moving forward. We don't want to immediately reopen every aspect of our society if it would cause the virus to rebound, which would make the economic pain we've already suffered pointless – and much worse."", 'So where does it leave us?', ""While there is still much we don't know, I am less cynical than some about the mitigation measures we've employed to slow the spread. If I weren't, I'd be freely moving about in public without fear of catching the virus. I do believe we have slowed the spread and saved lives."", 'But I am also very saddened by the immeasurable economic devastation and suffering. While some may be too readily dismissing the threat of the virus, others are unspeakably insensitive to the financial disruption and pain people are experiencing, and callous about mitigating it.', ""We have to be prudent moving forward. Even with these new findings on lethality, we have nowhere near approached herd immunity, so the virus is still highly contagious. We don't want to immediately reopen every aspect of our society if it would cause the virus to rebound, which would make the economic pain we've already suffered pointless – and much worse. So, I think the administration is wise in recommending a phased-in approach and deferring, when practicable, to state authorities."", ""I trust that the more we learn and the more testing we have, the better we'll be able to combat the virus if it resurfaces in the fall and in subsequent years. Scientists will be armed with more widespread antibody tests as well as tests to determine whether people have the disease so that contact tracing can be used to find who they might have infected. Officials will also have developed efficient systems and strategies for preventing flare-ups from igniting full-blown outbreaks."", 'We can then employ a more targeted approach against the virus that will not cause economic devastation, as research confirms that the virus is far more deadly to certain groups: the elderly and those with certain underlying health conditions. Until we develop herd immunity, less vulnerable groups can freely move about, and more vulnerable ones can self-isolate.', 'As we reflect on this crisis, we must also reflect on our precious constitutional liberties and consider how quickly they can be compromised in actual or perceived national emergencies. While individuals and businesses deserve to receive relief funds from the government because it forced them to suspend their economic activities, we must now soberly consider our national debt and the existential threat it represents to the republic.', 'CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP', 'Perhaps we will become more responsible about our out-of-control federal spending, which can only be rectified by entitlement reform – a subject we can no longer afford to avoid.', 'Pray for America and those hurting from this pandemic.', 'CLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY DAVID LIMBAUGH']"

', 'What happened to Roger Stone, by the way, is a travesty. That needs to be thrown out, like yesterday. ', ""Breaking now as we come on, 9:00 in the East, 6:00 in the West Coast -- we can confirm, FOX News can confirm a full-scale federal investigation into the origins of COVID-19 is now underway. That means investigators are now focused on a biological testing lab in Wuhan, China. That's the province where according to our own Bret Baier and his exclusive reporting, patient zero apparently contracted that virus from a bat. "", ""Officials do not at this time believe the outbreak was linked to any kind of manmade biological weapons program. They're saying they do not believe the contamination was intentional, and instead, what Bret sources are reporting is that China was so desperate to compete with American scientists that the Wuhan lab cut corners, relaxed safety measures, and as a result, one of their workers was apparently, accidentally, they say, infected and then spread the highly contagious disease all throughout the province of Wuhan. "", ""Now, in the days and the weeks that followed, this is where it gets even worse, China's government engaged in what is now a deadly cover-up to -- that led to widespread carnage all over the world. That U.K. study said 95 percent of those could've been prevented. "", ""What the Chinese Communist Party did is unforgivable. China erased data, doctors, scientists, they just disappeared, some frontline doctors tried to warn the world, they're dead from COVID-19. China shut down the city of Wuhan from all domestic travel. If you lived in China, you couldn't travel in and out of Wuhan. If you live in Wuhan, you couldn't travel anywhere else in China. "", 'Think about this -- in what is a reckless, deadly act, China continued international flights to and from the city. They protected themselves, but not the rest of the world. ', 'If these reports are all true, you know what that means? The Communist Chinese government has blood on their hands, and must pay for this vile, inhumane conduct. ', ""Two Republican lawmakers have now unveiled legislation that would allow Americans to sue China's government. "", ""Now, I'll take it a step further. The United States should now consider withholding all debt payments until we recoup our losses from China's deadly virus and reckless behavior. They protected themselves, nobody else. They knew how bad it was. "", 'Now, of course, China will never be able to repay the colossal loss of life, the indescribable suffering, sickness, death all over the globe that their actions cause. ', 'And the World Health Organization -- Health Organization, really? Well, they too have blood on their hands. It was a WHO, and its director general acting as a propaganda arm for the communist Chinese, and according to reports, actively, knowingly, helped China cover their tracks. ', ""Now, the WHO might as well pack up and move to Beijing because it's not seeing another dime, should not see another dime from we, the American people. As long as President Trump is in office, I tend to think they won't. "", 'Here now with his -- he\'s the host of ""Special Report"", Bret Baier. ', ""All right. Bret, now, officials, what they are saying, they don't believe the outbreak was linked to any kind of manmade biological weapons program, according to your report. They don't believe the contamination was intentional. "", 'Do we know this for certain, or is there a possibility that it was manufactured? Is there a possibility the spread was intentional? You confirmed in your recording they protected their country, but they left the rest of this world get this virus. ', 'BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Yes, Sean, good evening. ', ""There is really zero confidence in people I've talked to, publicly that this was a man-made virus. It you heard it Tony Fauci ask this question in a way about the lab in the White House task force briefing tonight, he said there were a lot of studies that showed it was transmitted from animal to human and that it was not genetically altered. That match what our sources had said and what reported at the beginning, that they didn't think based on the structure of the genome of the virus that -- that it was man-made. "", ""Now, there are -- the thing that is inconclusive is exactly about the lab. But more and more dots, both open source and classified, point right to the lab. That's why we are increasing in confidence. "", 'What there is 100 percent confidence of, and we reported this, and now, more and more officials are saying it publicly, is the level and extent of the cover-up China went to, and part of those dots fit into why there is such a point at looking at this lab. ', 'Secretary Pompeo talking about it publicly today with Hugh Hewitt on the radio. ', ""HANNITY: Now, 98 percent -- we do know this from SARS, most people may not remember, SARS was also a coronavirus, and according to the scientists and doctors I interviewed, when they broke down the sequence in record time, which is why we are in stage one trials for the vaccine, there was a 98 percent similar sequence as SARS, again, another coronavirus which would lend itself to the theory that they didn't do this intentionally, meaning, create the virus. It was there. "", 'What is the exact evidence that, you know, they are giving you? What are they saying specifically behind this report that proves this? ', ""BAIER: On the manmade part. Yes, well, they believe that this doctor, Shi Zhengli, who was working in the Wuhan virology lab, was essentially working on antiviral immunization efforts. That's what our sources are saying. That's what matches some of the reports that were out from the University of South China and others, that there were author's to study the virus in the very lab. "", ""And basically that the non-manmade part is pointing specifically to the genetic mapping of this virus right now. And that it hopped from an animal to human, and it was not altered in its genetic sequence. That's what we get (ph). "", ""HANNITY: And just -- and just to be clear, in your reporting, you are saying that it was -- the Chinese knew it was dangerous enough that they weren't allowing flights in or out of Wuhan to any other part of China, but they were allowing it to the rest of the world, which would say they knew it was that dangerous? "", ""BAIER: Well, then you look at other elements there, dots on the board, that is how much they went to scrub all of the data. The fact that you can't find some of these doctors, including Shi Zhengli, who was working on it. The fact that some of the samples were destroyed, the fact that just today, Sean, the Chinese government re-announced an increase in the dots total in Wuhan by 50 percent. "", ""HANNITY: By 50 percent, what a joke. That's sick. "", ""BAIER: And that's just today. "", 'HANNITY: Unbelievable. ', 'All right. Bret Baier, great job, thank you for your reporting. Thanks for sharing with our viewers. ', ""Now, during a time when we need the most America's intelligence apparatus is reportedly not operating at full strength inside of China. They are still hiding. Over the past decade, more than a dozen suspected American assets were jailed or killed, including one individual who was shot outside a government building. "", 'Make no mistake: Donald Trump was right from the get-go. China is not controlled by the benevolent leaders. Instead, its people are ruled by a barbaric dictatorship that profits from their suffering. ', 'Here now with reaction to that, FOX News contributor, former CIA station chief, Dan Hoffman, China expert Gordon Chang is with us. ', ""Dan, look, you've been in some very hostile areas across the world, I don't want to let it be known everything I know about your back on. That wouldn't be fair. But you risk your life. So have many other in the brave intel community. They risk their lives, one of my buttons is for those 99 percent of people here that risk their lives for us. "", ""DAN HOFFMAN, RETIRED CIA SENIOR INTELLIGENCE OFFICER: Yes, you know the Wuhan virology institute is the primary target right now for the intelligence community, it's not just the CIA, it's also the DIA as well as our overhead reconnaissance and signals intelligence. We want to know as much as we can about that lab. "", 'We know that they have a maximum-security lab that conducts experiments with the most dangerous viruses. We need to know about their safety regulations. What we really need to know is something about patient zero who got this whole thing started. And I think that our country is getting a good lesson right now in Chinese propaganda. ', ""It exists to obfuscate the truth. Their regime security depends on it. They want to whitewash China's reputation overseas and deny their citizens the truth. That's how they stay in power. "", ""HANNITY: Gordon, let me go to you. I mean, you know a lot about this, let's go back to Bret Baier's reporting here. He says officials don't believe the outbreak links any kind of man-made bio weapons program. That might be provable because of the similarity sequence breakdown with SARS, also a coronavirus. And they don't believe it was intentional, but it certainly speaks volumes that they allowed no travel out of Wuhan into any other part of China, or no travel from China into Wuhan, but they let the travel out of Wuhan to the rest of the world. "", 'GORDON CHANG, AUTHOR, ""THE COMING COLLAPSE OF CHINA"": Yes, the story gets even worse, Sean, because China admitted for the first time that this disease was transmissible human to human, H2H, on January 20. But Doctors and Wuhan knew by the second week of December that it was H2H, which meant that Beijing knew about it just a few days later. ', ""And, you know, when you start to think about this, if China had said nothing about H2H for those five and a half, six weeks, that would've been irresponsible. But Beijing deliberately tried to tell the world there was no H2H, and they enlisted the World Health Organization in that, which means, people around the world, health officials around the world were lulled into not taking precautions that they otherwise would have adopted because of the deliberate falsification from Beijing, which was amplified by the WHO. "", ""HANNITY: Look, this is an area of expertise you have, could they be that evil? They know it was awful. They weren't letting anyone travel there or out of there to their country. "", ""CHANG: Well, when you look at the facts, Sean, you have to conclude that the only explanation that fits the facts is that when Xi Jinping -- I'm not saying this is a bio weapon -- but when Xi Jinping saw what the coronavirus did to cripple this country, I think you wanted to level the playing field. And if, in fact, he wanted to deliberately spread this, he would have done exactly what in fact he did. "", ""So, that's the only explanation that I can come up with. "", 'HANNITY: Dan -- ', ""CHANG: You can say, for instance, it's reckless. But clearly, I think it's malicious. "", ""HANNITY: Dan, you've seen a lot of people in the world. You've put yourself in dangerous, precarious situations all your -- your entire career, this is a pretty high scale of human evil. "", ""HOFFFMAN: It is. Listen, you could go all the way to the dark side where Gordon is, I see that point. And probably, the kindest thing I could ever say is that this is Xi Jinping's Chernobyl. "", 'HANNITY: Yes. ', 'HOFFMAN: Very eerily similar to what the Soviets went through in 1986 were they purposely failed to disclose the worst nuclear accident in the history of the world and caused countless deaths in the region and beyond. And that is essentially the same thing China did. ', ""They arrested individuals who tried to ring alarm bells as Gordon noted. They obfuscated the truth, lots of propaganda and disinformation, all designed to ensure that they would remain in power. And we need to hold China accountable for their treachery, for their corruption, I think that that's what the end game is for this investigation. "", 'HANNITY: And the World Health Organization. ', 'Gordon, Dan, thank you both. ', ""If you don't think it can happen, think back to the last century alone. OK, Mao, China, communism, fascism, Nazism, and Imperial Japan, the killing fields, Cambodia, (INAUDIBLE) over 100 million humans killed in the last century. "", ""You don't think evil happens? It does, sadly. It's sick, it's ugly. It is repulsive. We need to get the truth. "", ""Now, some positive developments, if we can say anything is positive surrounding our country's fight against COVID-19. Researchers at Stanford University, they were combing the local population there to find residents with antibodies. Remember, two weeks ago, we didn't have the antibody tests. Now, we have millions of them thanks to Abbott. "", ""Now, they discovered that the infection rate may be 85 times higher than reported. In other words, a significant amount of the population may have been exposed without getting sick enough to report symptoms. That would suggest, again, we are looking at the numbers here, exponentially the possibility that the death rate could be as low, or even lower than the seasonal flu. We'll continue to monitor, time will tell. "", ""Now, the situation in New York continues, thankfully, to improve. Hospitalizations have now declined for the fourth straight day. That graph has been what we are hoping for, leveling, falling off, now we're looking for the precipitous drop. "", ""Incubations are also on the decline, that continues. The death rate appears to have flattened, and thanks to the president's numerous actions, New York never ran data ventilators, never ran out of hospital beds. Received millions and millions of masks, and gloves, and gowns, and shields from the federal stockpile. "", 'The USNS Comfort, the emergency 3,000-bed hospital at the Javits Center are still operational. Both were modified to accept COVID-19 patients, not an easy task to change the ventilation system. All workers in both the facilities were manned by our great military, at the request of the president, to help out New York and New Jersey. Also at the direction of the president, the federal government directed what amounted to a massive amount of resources to New York, New Jersey, Connecticut. ', ""And in spite of -- well, my efforts, I've been trying to bridge the gap between the governor of New York and the president, clearly it's not going to work. It's not happening. "", ""Today, Governor Cuomo is complaining, I need, I need, I need. Why doesn't he make this call private? Governor Cuomo, make the calls request privately. You do that, he's given you all this stuff, you are provoking a fight. It's not good. "", 'You got to save the people of New York. Watch. ', '(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ', 'GOV. ANDREW CUOMO (D-NY): First of all, if he is sitting home watching TV, maybe he should be getting up and going to work. ', ""I've said a number of times, I don't know what I'm supposed to do, send a bouquet of flowers? I said the one issue we need help with is testing. He said 11 times, I don't want to get involved in testing, it's too complicated, it's too hard. "", ""No one can take the posture, we'll just say thank you for what I've done and I'm now out. I'm not doing anything else. "", ""I don't think the president of the United States to read the Constitution for me. He should read the Constitution before he says he has the power to open the states. "", '(END VIDEO CLIP) ', ""HANNITY: Why do you have to, Governor, why do have to keep asking publicly? I had Governor Cuomo, on my radio show yesterday. I want him to succeed, I want New York to recover, I don't want anyone else to die. "", ""He's got to stop with the political theater. I need I need -- the president gave, gave, gave, gave, gave. Ask for help rightly, especially since he told me yesterday, he delivered it big time for New York. "", ""If he keeps using these press sessions as public venting sessions and demand sessions from everything from the federal government, this relationship is not going to work. I'm trying to be a peacemaker here. Now, why couldn't he just say he's working with the federal government to get more testing and other resources? Because it's not as simple as snapping your fingers, I need 1,000 ventilators. "", ""He said the president does respond quickly every single time, all the things he wanted, they've all asked for the decision to -- they want to make them themselves -- OK. The president gave it to you. Then you can't demand that the present do anything when you got what you wanted. You are in charge. "", ""Governor Cuomo wants to be in charge of reopening his state. OK, do it. Instead of demands, call testing companies, call thermometer companies, it's not that hard. "", ""I've already offered the Hannity plan what I think we should do to open New York City. That's the smallest geographical area, largest number of people, some days 11 plus million people there. "", 'Now, masks, gloves, temperature checks to get into any building. Wearing a mask in the building, half the workforce should continue to work remotely, from home, so you have more social distancing in every New York City building. ', ""Also, open -- let's think about reopening -- you see that, that's Yankee stadium. Yankees, I talked to Randy Levine, one of their top executives today. It they will do anything that is asked of them, anything. They want to do it, and do it safely. "", 'They will work with the governor. They will work with the president. It they can open Citi Fields to the Mets. We can open the Meadowlands to the Jets and Giants. How do you do it? ', ""Well, here's my idea. Test all the employees who serve the public at these events. That means the players, the coaches, the trainers, the ticket takers, all food handlers. They've got to a positive COVID ID test. We can do that, thanks to Abbott. "", ""Now, Randy Levine rightly pointed out, I can report the Yankees will go all in and do whatever is needed to keep every fan safe. I'm sure every MLB team, every NFL team, every college team, they will do what's needed. They will do the right thing, they will follow the rules. "", ""If it means, OK, I want to go to the game, you got to put on a mask. It's not ideal. You can eat popcorn, but you can probably go like this and eat a -- take a bite of your hot dog and chew it with your mask on, and then take a straw and drink your beer. "", ""You'd probably do -- I would rather do that than stay home, myself. That's the Hannity plan.

It's doable, inconvenient, it's thankfully, only temporary.

The biggest help, mobilization in the history of the world, that's what we are now living through. Now, by the way, got a lot of for say -- for having the travel ban quarantined, and then subsequent travel bans. "", ""If they want to go the governors alone, OK, you are right. There's the 10th Amendment, good luck.

', 'Either way, the city of Wuhan is now reporting that more than 3,800 people died from coronavirus. That is a sudden increase of nearly 1,300 people, or almost 50 percent of the previous number.

', 'Three weeks ago, 39-year-old Danny Lemos of Nebraska was diagnosed with COVID-19. He believes he got it from his dad who works at a beef plant. JBS in Grand Island, Nebraska, where there are about 240 confirmed cases. He was put on a ventilator. He was told he had a 20 percent chance of survival. ', 'Thankfully, Lemos walked out of that hospital to the cheers of his children late last month. On Monday, the governor of his state is reopening many of the businesses in many places in Nebraska, hair and nail salons, restaurants, places of worship, all with safety protocols in place and limits on capacity. But Lemos says he thinks that is crazy. ', 'The governor of Nebraska, Pete Ricketts, is standing by and we will speak with him in just a moment. He says that the data supports his plan, but we begin this evening with Danny Lemos. ', 'Danny, thank you for being here. First of all, we are very happy that you are home with your family now. ', 'DANNY LEMOS, RECOVERED FROM COVID-19: Yes. ', ""MACCALLUM: That is certainly good news. And your dad, who you believe you've got this from, is still in the hospital, right? "", ""LEMOS: Yes, he's actually, he's still in ICU in St. Elizabeth's in Lincoln. "", ""MACCALLUM: So, he is definitely he's going to have a good recovery. Yes. We're so glad that you did. "", ""LEMOS: He's definitely on the uphill climate thing, so. "", ""MACCALLUM: Good. Well, that's good news. We're glad to hear it. Why do you - why are you so against with what the governor is deciding to do, given the fact that only 70 people have died in Nebraska and there are very - can you hear me OK, Danny? "", 'LEMOS: I can, I hear you now. ', ""MACCALLUM: You can hear me now? All right, so we're going to try to reestablish our connection with Danny. Sometimes it's a bit tricky. But let's go over and talk to the Nebraska Governor, Pete Ricketts, and then we'll come back to Danny if we can get his signal back. "", ""Governor, thank you, first of all, for being here tonight on The Story. We've been talking to a lot of the nation's governors on this show. Basically, there's a lot of concern about reopening, especially since Nebraska has some real hot spots that have been cropping up just over the past couple of weeks. And a number of people have died, particularly at these meatpacking and meat producing plants. So, what do you say to them and what do you say to Danny? "", ""PETE RICKETTS, NEBRASKA GOVERNOR: Well, hey, first of all, thank you very much for having me on, and we're very grateful for Mr. Lemos' recovery. So, that's a good thing. And I think what we've got to take a step back to a couple of months ago and remember is that every public health expert in the country said, look, you cannot stop this virus from coming. You can't even change the area under the curve, which means you can't stop people from getting infected because nobody's got immunity. "", ""What you can do is spread this out so that it doesn't overwhelm your health care system. And that's what we've accomplished with those - the steps we put in place here in Nebraska. So, we've flattened that curve. Everybody who's needed a ventilator has been able to get that ventilator. Everybody need hospital beds being able to get it. And so now what we've done is and the analogy I use is it's like we can end nearly every traffic death by taking the speed limit on the interstate down to five miles an hour. We don't do that. "", ""But that's essentially what we've done with our economy, with all these restrictions put in place. And it's been successful. It's worked. We haven't overwhelmed our health care system. We've got lots of capacity all across the state in Nebraska and especially in our metropolitan areas. "", ""Now, what we're going to do is gradually release these restrictions so that we can find what is that right speed where we can allow people to start returning to a somewhat normal life, but still make sure that we don't overwhelm the health care system that everybody, like Mr. Lemos can get access to that ventilator. "", ""MACCALLUM: Yes. So, the model show that you're still 11 days away from the peak in Nebraska. And that July 4th is when the models predict would be a good time to begin to make the changes that you are starting to put into place. And, you know, just to give you the words of one of your - one of the other politicians in Nebraska, Adam Morfeld, he is a Democrat. "", ""He thinks that it is too early. Says, I think we've gone from being medically informed to a political calculation and that's dangerous when we haven't even reached our peak. What do you say to that? Why not wait just a few more weeks? "", ""RICKETTS: Well, a couple of things. Bunch of good reasons. First of all, the data doesn't support waiting. If you look at Omaha, for example, we could probably take at least 10, if not 20 times the cases per day and still be well able to handle everything in our hospital system. So, we have plenty of capacity in our hospital system right now. "", ""Second thing I'd say is Dr. Khan, University of Nebraska Medical Center will tell you, models are not predictive. If you look at the IHME model, for example, it bounces all around every day from the state of Nebraska, and I'm sure other states as well. "", 'And the final thing and this goes back to, again, what we talked about with our experts two months ago is that the more you restrict the longer may people wait, more people are just going to break this quarantine anyway. ', ""So, Nebraskans have been very patient. They've made a lot of sacrifices and it has all worked. We've got to get back to, it's not about the cases. As we test more people, we're going to have more cases. That's just a fact. So, what we have to focus on the thing that doesn't change, which is how many people are going to the hospital. "", 'If we make sure we manage that we can make sure that we got our health care system00 ', 'MACCALLUM: Understood. And we have always put a lot more focus on hospitalizations than anything else, because the case number, the more you test, the more the case number will go up. But you have a particular situation at these meat plants and a concentration of cases and people who are getting sick, who work at them and complaints from some of the workers that there is plastic partitions that still have them only inches apart. ', ""And because there's not enough testing, comprehensive testing at these plants, you don't know if the guy or the woman next to you has it. And although there has been compensation increase - money and compensation to keep people coming. A lot of those individuals are very concerned about the work environment that they're in. And yet, as we understand it, the President wants to keep these meat processing plants open. Is that true? "", ""RICKETTS: Well, not only does the President want to keep them open, I want to keep them open. It's very important that we keep them open so that we can continue to have a strong food supply chain. And there's no doubt that the facilities are very difficult to do social distancing, as are the homes the people are coming from, because a lot of times they've got higher concentrations of people and multiple generations. So, we've got to take a community wide approach to be able to tackle this problem. And that's what we're doing. "", ""We're working with the food processors. I've been on the phone with them for weeks. We have a weekly phone call established. Our University of Nebraska Medical Center and their Global Center for Health Security has published a COVID-19 playbook, which is best practices for all the facilities. "", ""We're working with the facilities to do inspections or tours, to be able to help them do a better job on this, to do better social distancing. And we're also reaching out to the communities, through our health clinics, through trusted people in the community, to do better education around social distancing, testing, contact tracing. I do Spanish language briefings a couple of times a week to get the message out there. "", ""We've got videos now. We've translated in French, Spanish, Nepalese, Somali, Arabic, I mean, you get the idea. It's about reaching out to those communities and making sure that both at work and at home, we're doing a good job of social distancing. "", ""MACCALLUM: So, let me ask you this. I understand that the Smithfield factory wanted to shut down, but they reversed that decision because they were under pressure to stay open. Is that true? And what if people who work there don't feel comfortable going to work? Will they be able to get their unemployment benefits? "", ""RICKETTS: So, I don't know that anybody, or I don't know if anybody putting pressure on Smithfield. They called us in the morning, said they were going to close, they call back in the afternoon and said, they had changed that position. So, from that standpoint, I don't believe so. "", ""With regard to unemployment benefits, I mean, first of all, I think a lot of the plants and I don't know specifically with Smithfield, I think it's true for Smithfield, but I have to check my facts. But anyway, they're offering short-term disability for folks who have to stay home because they're sick. I know a lot of the plants are just paying people two weeks, pay time off if they're sick. So, they're really focusing on trying to get people to stay home where if one of their family members are staying home. "", ""And again, with regard to unemployment benefits, if you've got that doctor's note that says that you're sick and this is why you're staying home, yes, you'd be eligible for unemployment benefits as well. "", ""MACCALLUM: OK. But you can't stay home if you're concerned about being too close to the other people on the line since there are so many people who seem to be getting it, that doesn't qualify. "", ""RICKETTS: No, that actually doesn't qualify. You actually have to have a reason. The reason could be, you've got children home because school's out. The reason could be that you're staying home to take care of somebody else or somebody in your household is sick.

So, Danny, tell us a little bit about your thoughts and why - you hear what the governor is saying. He says, we have enough capacity to take care of people who get sick. We understand that the virus is taking its course. But he believes that there are places that can safely open up in your state. What do you say?

You know, I mean, I literally was on my deathbed at one point and I was healthy with no under lending health issues. "", ""So, I don't know. It's just seems crazy to me. I know that this isn't any life to live as far as being stuck in your house, being quarantined all the time. So, I mean, something needs to be done. I don't know how you do it. I mean, we had what, 70 more cases today alone here in the Granite Island area. And then I think I read earlier that Georgia just reopened up and they had, what, 1000 cases within 24 hours. What can we do different? So, that we don't run into those issues. "", ""MACCALLUM: It's a good question. And you also have to ask, you know, is it going to spread to other communities because you've got these hot spots in Nebraska that are experiencing it right now? Before I let you go, I want to ask you, when I read in your story and said that you were given Remdesivir and you may have heard. I know you've been recovering that that drug is now received FDA approval. "", ""But it looked to me from what you said that you didn't feel like that made a difference in your case. And I'm just curious what your experience was. "", 'LEMOS: Well, I think the article that you read had a few things mixed up because that was absolutely a game changer in my recovery. 100 percent.

There's no doubt in my mind, because within 48 hours of them treating me with that, with the first time, like I said, I'd pulled my vent out. I've got put on hyper oxygen. I was up walking around, eating with all my family. Everything like I went from being as low as I could get to feel like the man on the moon, like-- "", ""MACCALLUM: That's really encouraging. I'm glad I asked you about it, because that Remdesivir obviously is, you know, something that people are hopeful about at this point. Do you also think the fact that the doctors resisted putting you on a ventilator and gave you that hyper oxygen was also a positive factor in your recovery? "", ""LEMOS: Absolutely, I do. 100 percent, you know, and it's hard to say, but I think there's a reason I pulled my vent out, you know, who knows how long I would have been on it without me taking myself off of it. I guess, you know. I don't know how much of that played any of it. I'm here today and I'm thankful for that.

So, thank you so much and thanks for hanging with us during the technical difficulties. Nice to have you with us tonight, sir. Be well. ', 'LEMOS: No problem. Thank you. ', ""MACCALLUM: You bet. Interesting. He said, Remdesivir was a big game changer for him, so we're going to follow that drug very closely. That's a bit of hopeful news. Up next, after New York's frantic scramble for hospital beds and ventilators, they built all these facilities. Hundreds of millions of dollars went into them. And now the state is facing some criticism for mismanagement. The former governor, George Pataki, joins us next with his story. "", '(COMMERCIAL BREAK) ', 'MACCALLUM: New concerns in New York tonight over waste and possible mismanagement after many things like ventilators and hospital beds and facilities went unused as the state battles COVID-19. ', 'FEMA is closing the Javits Center after reportedly treating 1000 patients in the 2500 bed facility in a month. And the USNS Comfort sailed out of New York after seeing few patients in terms of its capacity as well. ', 'Here now, former governor of New York, former New York Governor George Pataki joins me. Governor Pataki, always good to see you, sir. Thank you very much for joining tonight. ', 'GEORGE PATAKI, FORMER NEW YORK GOVERNOR: Thank you, Martha. ', ""MACCALLUM: Right. So, you know, obviously, it's good news that these facilities that were built weren't maxed out and overflowing. That would have been a complete nightmare for a city that has already endured the burden, the biggest burden of this. But it does raise questions about whether or not, you know, hundreds of millions of dollars went into building these facilities that were based on models that should not have been adhered to. "", ""PATAKI: Absolutely right, Martha. But it's not just about wasting money, as bad as that is. It's about losing lives. And I know Andrew Cuomo is one of the most popular politicians in America today. He has his briefings that are calm and informative. But when you look at the job that he is not doing when it comes to nursing homes, those beds should have been used to put the most vulnerable in those facilities. "", ""What happened in New York in my mind is a disgrace. The state directed nursing homes, and the one thing we know about this virus is the most vulnerable were the elderly. They directed that nursing homes take Coronavirus positive patients when they didn't have that protection, personal protective equipment. they didn't have the facilities. "", ""And as a consequence, we are approaching 4000 deaths in New York from nursing homes alone. Yes, they have wasted assets. Those positive patients should have been placed in the Javits Center or on the Comfort. They weren't. It's a failed policy and it's really sad for the people of New York, particularly those families who have lost loved ones. "", ""MACCALLUM: Yes, I mean, it's a policy that is just almost impossible to wrap your head around. There's one facility that has the Isabella Geriatric Center. They lost 98 people from that center. It's 14 percent of their total - in their total residents. "", ""And I don't understand - do you understand why Governor Cuomo didn't use, because we heard that the Comfort had been reconfigured so that it could accept COVID patients, they could have space them out and given everyone plenty of room on that ship. So, I can't even imagine if your family member - how you feel about the fact that they weren't sent there. "", ""PATAKI: Martha, New York's policies with nursing homes is incomprehensible. As you said, the Comfort had hundreds of beds waiting to take Coronavirus positive patients and the nursing homes were at the weakest of the age at the most vulnerable were put together, are required to take Coronavirus positive patients. "", ""It is an incomprehensible policy. And Martha. I think someone should look into it, not just the lost assets, but the policies that allowed nursing homes. First of all, not to get personal protective equipment. When asked whether he would help the nursing homes, the nurses, the orderlies, the people in those facilities, the governor said it's not his job. "", ""Well, in a crisis, it is his job to get personal protective equipment to everyone who is in need and then to demand that they take Corona positive patients. It's just senseless. So, we don't want this to happen again. Not in New York, not in any other state. Martha, we know there are going to be other health crises down the road, whether it's next year or next decade or the next generation. Someone should look into the misguided policies of Governor Cuomo with respect to New York's nursing homes, so that they never happen again. "", ""MACCALLUM: No. I mean, it's a tragedy and a lot of these bodies that we're seeing stories of in U halls, in Brooklyn are just atrocious. And given the amount of resources that were surged to New York City, it raises a lot of questions about how those resources were used. And one can't help but look at these conditions and ask, you know, do we not care because these people are of a certain age? Because that's an unacceptable answer. And the lives that could have been saved is a real factor. Not all of these people had to die in these nursing homes just because they're old. "", ""Governor Pataki, thank you. It's always good to see you, sir. "", 'PATAKI: Nice to see you, Martha. Stay well. ', ""MACCALLUM: All right, you too, be well. So, coming up next, newly released documents raise some serious questions about the FBI's handling of the Michael Flynn case, which we have documented here on The Story throughout the whole week. Trey Gowdy is very plugged in. I've been on this story since the very beginning. So, he's going to tell us what he thinks about what is now being revealed, which he was aware of. And why did Robert Mueller's team not report these documents? "", '(COMMERCIAL BREAK) ', ""MACCALLUM: So, after the bombshell, FBI notes revealed these telling comments as agents prepare to go to the White House to interrogate National Security Adviser General Michael Flynn, telling him that he didn't need a lawyer not to worry about that. They had written on a Bill Priestap, who is head of counterintelligence at the FBI, wrote this on a piece paper. "", ""What is our goal? Truth, admission, or to get him to lie so we can prosecute him and get him fired? Lawyers and former agents are coming to the defense of the bureau, including the lawyer for the Ukraine whistleblower saying this, the FBI notes reveal consideration of routine law enforcement interview tactics and by no means undercut General Flynn's prior admissions of lying to the FBI, a felony and accepting full responsibility for his actions. "", ""To which, Kim Strassel at The Wall Street Journal fired back. As for liberal commentators, legal scholars saying that all of this is routine. Well, let's sure as hell hope not. The FBI exists to investigate crimes, not create them. That from Kim Strassel at the Journal. "", 'Here now, Trey Gowdy, Fox News Contributor and former Chairman of the House Oversight Committee. Trey, welcome. Good to have you here. ', 'TREY GOWDY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Thank you. ', 'MACCALLUM: What do you think? Was the notes. Were the notes and was the investigation of General Michael Flynn at the White House routine for the FBI and for the agents who carried it out? ', ""GOWDY: I hope not, Martha. And if it is routine, then why didn't they apply the same standard to Hillary Clinton that they did to Michael Flynn. I mean if you go back, so Flynn's under an investigation in the summer of 2016. A counterintelligence investigation. The FBI found nothing. They didn't find an insufficient amount of evidence. They found no evidence and they're about to close this investigation and then he has the conversation with Kislyak. "", ""So, Comey decides to send bureau agents to the White House. Why? I mean that's that fundamental question. Were you investigating a crime, the Logan Act which never been a prosecution under that Act? Or were you conducting a counterintelligence investigation? "", ""If it's a criminal interview, then why did you treat him so differently than the way you did with Hillary Clinton. "", ""Remember, Martha, she had a medium-sized law firm in the room with her. They gave the question to her lawyers before they interviewed her, and they mostly assuredly told her there's a consequence for lying, none of which they did for Michael Flynn Flynn. "", ""MACCALLUM: So I spoke with K.T. McFarland last night who was his deputy, General Flynn's deputy, and she says, you know, that it is really, beyond Flynn, they were hoping that if they pressed him hard enough, and put him in a tough enough position, and held some of his earlier comments against what he said there, that he would flip on President Trump. That he would give up some goods on the president. Do you agree? "", ""GOWDY: Well, I do for this reason. There's a notation in these documents or at least this week to use that defensive briefing as a pretense, as a rule. So, everyone that's offered a defensive briefing by the FBI, keep that in mind. They may be interviewing you. "", 'Remember, Comey did the same thing with Trump. He gave this defensive briefing on the dossier, but he was really interviewing him. They still thought Donald Trump was colluding with Russia when they went to interview with Michael Flynn. ', ""So, I have every expectation they wanted to flip Flynn on the president. The problem was no one with the campaign was colluding with Russia. It wasn't Flynn, it wasn't Trump. It wasn't Papadopoulos. They were wrong about all four of their crossfire hurricane targets. "", ""MACCALLUM: So how come when we heard from Robert Mueller and the investigation two years, and millions and millions of dollars was finished, and we got the report, where were these notes that we're seeing now? "", ""GOWDY: They were not turned over. They have to be turned over if they're going to trial. There's a little bit of debate about it, but I think most people will tell you Brady does not implicate guilty pleas. "", ""So, when Michael Flynn said, I'm going to plead, they didn't have to turn over the notes. But, Martha, this is not the department of, let's see if we can get away with it. And it's not the department of let's see who we can get fired. "", ""It is the Department of Justice. Sally Yates who is hardly a Republican was infuriated when she found out what Comey had done. So that's the Department of Justice. We don't care if you're an R or D, we don't care whether we like you or we don't. We are going to treat you the same. Mueller's folks did not turn over these documents because they didn't think they had to. "", 'MACCALLUM: Yes. With regard to the Durham investigation, because all of this happens with that as a backdrop now. And the reason that we are seeing these documents, and that they were released is because of a subsequent investigation or review of the Michael Flynn situation that was, you know, spurred on by the Attorney General Bill Barr and the Missouri attorney. ', ""So, what does this tell us about what is coming? Because we're also told that Barr and Durham are in pretty regular discussion about the Durham investigation. "", ""GOWDY: Yes. I think the attorney general and U.S. attorney Durham are both very interested in how this whole sordid affair began. So, the four targets, let's just go with Flynn. All right. You're going to put a general under counterintelligence investigation by the world's premier law enforcement agency, why? "", 'What is the factual predicate where you think you have the power to put him under counterintelligence investigation for being an agent of Russia? What was it? I mean, did he read a Chekhov novel? Did he watch Dr. Zhivago? Why did you put Michael Flynn under counterintelligence investigation? ', ""I think that's what Durham and Barr are getting at. None of these investigations were sufficiently factually predicated, and if that's true, then you're going to see a clamping down on the power that we've given the FBI. And it's about damn (Ph) time. "", ""MACCALLUM: Do you think we'll see prosecutions? "", ""GOWDY: No, ma'am. No, ma'am. I was talking to a federal prosecutor on the way over here. But we have got to not only associate accountability with prosecutions. I don't think it -- I think being a terrible FBI agent and treating people unfairly, it may ought to be a crime but I don't think it is a crime. "", ""The take away is, the next time the FBI says they want to talk, tell them no. Tell them, when you clean up your act, when you quit trying to get people fired and see what you can get away with, we will start treating you like this fascinating(Ph) law enforcement agency. But until then, no, thanks, we're done talking with you. "", 'MACCALLUM: Try Gowdy, always good to see you, sir. Thanks for coming in tonight. ', ""GOWDY: Yes, ma'am. You too. Yes, ma'am.

Where is that for Tara Reade, Leslie? ', 'MARSHALL: Well, first of all, I think that every victim male or female that comes forward, and I know this myself as a victim should be believed.

I do look at the investigation that I make on my own as a victim. If is absolutely right for Ms. Reade to feel, because the media didn't cover it, the president didn't speak out against this, that she's being treated differently. "", ""Look, when Dr. Ford came out, Donald Trump actually mocked her. He's been kind of quiet about this, and so as the media. And I think there are a couple of reasons for that. "", ""One, COVID-19, but I also think that there are some credibility issues with Ms. Reade that eventually some people have with Dr. Ford that we didn't see at the onset. And obviously there are going to be a lot of questions when anybody comes up with the timing of somebody in politics who is running for office, especially for the presidency of the United States. "", ""MACCALLUM: Yes. I guess it's the question of, you know, of being given the benefit of the doubt, it feels like Joe Biden is getting that in many ways.

Wade. So that makes a motive a lot more clear in her story. Does it not? ', ""MARSHALL: No, I don't think it makes the motive a lot more clear. I think quite frankly their motives on both sides. One of the things that I wrote about in my column, as you know, and one of the things that I have a real problem with as a victim, is somebody who, like Ms. Reade who has championed in a sense, their perpetrator.

Meaning, 1 percent of 100 is 1, but a half percent of 1,000 is 50. Dana, check my numbers so I know this is right. The fact is we have already had 58,000 dead. ', 'And if it keeps going like this over time, you can get pretty close to the predictions, a disease many times worse than the flu on top of the flu. But maybe it is time for people, meaning the young and the healthy, to return to work so we can afford to protect the elderly and the infirmed. And most important, people need to go back to the job. ', ""And be careful and see their doctors for their usual heart, liver, and lung ailments. If they don't, the Coronavirus will kill many more people without even trying. You know, Juan, the author Daniel Murphy was chairman of the Department of Emergency Medicine at Saint Barnabas in the Bronx, so he is on the frontlines. He has seen it all. "", ""And yet, he was emphatically saying we have to rapidly get back to work. So, I mean, that's hard to ignore, right? "", ""JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS HOST: Yeah. I mean, I thought the information he presented, especially about people who were suffering strokes, heart attacks, and then not going to the hospital because they were afraid. That's very real, because that doesn't stop. You know, you got to take that into account. But I must say. I wanted to underline something you said about, you know, you presented it as the prism of two ideas. "", ""But I think if distancing, in fact, has helped lower what we have seen in terms, not only infection, but therefore deaths, so it's like two interlocking ideas, as I was listening to you. And I think you have got to realize. I think as of today, we have a million people in this country who have tested positive for Coronavirus. "", ""But that's, Greg, only with about -- I think it's 1.6 percent of the nation having been tested. So we, in order to really protect ourselves, we need to have more robust testing that would allow us to identify hotspots, to engage in contact-tracing, to try to halt widespread, you know, sort of exponential spread of this disease. "", 'Dr. Fauci said in an interview, I think it was yesterday, this disease is not going away with the summer weather. He thinks it may stick around. And he thinks only by being cautious are we protecting ourselves from even a more devastating outbreak. ', ""GUTFELD: Yeah. You know, Dana, when I was talking about the prism of two ideas, I was talking about the mistakes people make when they're looking at this, the fact that it's either this or it's this when it's actually a combination. I think there are going to be people, this might be a safe prediction who will say, see, I told you this was no big deal after they see -- after they choose to ignore the fact that our social distancing helped flatten the curve. "", ""DANA PERINO, FOX NEWS HOST: Right. And then actually, they could even go back the other way, too. It's -- you are going to see a lot of -- we -- and you are right. We could debate it forever, or we could also celebrate the fact that Americans did what we were asked, right? We were able to prevent the hospitals from being overwhelmed. And Governor Cuomo said that today. "", ""He said the hospitals did not get overwhelmed. And I think that people are mistaking something, like, when you say you want to reopen America, that's not a synonym for ignoring the virus. "", 'GUTFELD: Right. ', ""PERINO: OK? So you can reopen America, recognizing that we have accomplished something that the government asked of us, which was a huge sacrifice, not just the stay at home part, but the people who have lost their jobs, their businesses, all the supply chains. Like, that's a huge sacrifice. We did that. The hospitals did not get overwhelmed. "", 'And so, people -- if you trust people, they can be responsible to try to get back and do the things that we need to do in order to keep our economy going so we can take care of all the people. Because in that New York Post piece, Greg, the doctor also said he was very worried about the people in the neighborhood. ', 'GUTFELD: Right. ', ""PERINO: The people who were standing in food lines for the first time, the poverty that is being basically imposed on them. So there are all of these concerns. So when you say you want to reopen America, it also -- it's not just because you think want to help President Trump win the election. That is a huge problem, and people should not fall into that. "", 'GUTFELD: Yeah. Jesse, I would like to read a quote from the doctor and get your response. Would you like to play along with me? ', 'JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS HOST: Please do. ', ""GUTFELD: Do you have the quote, producer? Put it up there. I've worked the Coronavirus frontline, and I say it's time to start opening up. Standing up to this virus can't be the job of essential workers only. We have been strong, but we are tired. And we need the rest of you to help us by getting back to work. So essentially, what I get him saying is that we should be sharing the risk. "", 'It is time, especially if you are young and healthy, to get out there and perhaps become part of the herd immunity that he mentions. ', 'WATTERS: Well, you have made this point before, is that this country kind of has a pain threshold. I feel like we are reaching that pain threshold, especially in certain parts of the country. You know, going back to last conversation, any intelligent person can make an argument that proves they were right, even though they were wrong. ', 'GUTFELD: Right. ', ""WATTERS: I mean, I do that all the time. I mean, it's what people do. Like, you can play the Super Bowl, and then the next day you can have all of these analysts on ESPN. They should run the ball. Why did they throw the ball? They should just ground and pound. Control the clock. Anybody can do that and look good. But you talk about the prism of two ideas. "", ""I think what we are seeing is the prism of 50 ideas. Because there are 50 governors in 50 states doing 50 different things. It's dynamic, flexible, and tailored. It's brilliant. And there are even mayors doing things different than governors with the governor's full consent. We are talking about restaurants, parks, elective surgeries. "", ""They are all being done differently based on the local county or states' health or economic landscape. And the one-size-fits-all policy would have been a catastrophe. Could you imagine treating New York like you treat Arkansas, or treating Arkansas like you treat New York? Like, that's what Obama wanted to do, this big national central policy. "", ""You would've heard talks of secession if that had happened. And also why it's so brilliant that they did this is because you are going be able to see in real time what's working and what's not. If you see a hotspot in a certain state, maybe they opened the gyms too early, right? You can see the mistakes being made in real-time. There's going to so much fresh data to chew on, that Dr. Birx's silk scarf is going to pop off of her neck. "", ""GUTFELD: That's quite a visual, Jesse. Emily, what are your thoughts? "", ""EMILY COMPAGNO, FOX NEWS HOST: Well, just to echo these op-eds, I think just like all of America helped flatten the curve. Now, it is up to us to help Americans get back to work and thrive. And that's why it's so crucial for state and local government leaders to send messages with their decision-making right now that they are prioritizing saving jobs, while acknowledging that it's a different normal that we are going back to. "", ""So Jesse mentioned restaurants. And the reason that I have been continuing to talk about the restaurant industry is not only because of its volume, right? It's a $900 billion industry as of last year, but also because it touches so many other industries, like manufacturing and shipping and Ag, and it has such a broad supply chain that touches millions of America. "", ""And so we can't just flip a switch and have these businesses go back to normal, where all of a sudden think that they have the ability to get back on their feet. And I want to take LA for example, that a lot of times we bash on this show. But right now, it's a really interesting case study, because the local government there, from the beginning, has been resisting and sending headwinds to the restaurant industry as they are trying to cope with this and implement new policies. "", 'But the mayor there, Mayor Garcetti, has been open to big, bold ideas. So for this time, I think it is incumbent upon all of us to support the creation of new policy, right, that acknowledges this that saves jobs, things like tip credits, and suspend those policies that are in existence right now that are hampstering (ph) these businesses from staying open, like certain class action litigation and things like that. ', ""In that example, in LA, the city and local government has been resisting because they are failing to see the forest for the trees, that it's a new normal. And things like retailing alcohol, things that have been put in place during this time, we need to consider moving forward that -- with his web that faces millions of Americans. "", ""We should look at all of these individual junctures and try to acknowledge the gives and carry these policies moving forward, because it's about saving these jobs so that we don't have an economic death, too. "", 'GUTFELD: Yeah. And also, alfresco, that is the solution right now. Move everything outdoors as the weather gets better. Put the -- close some of the streets down. Let the restaurants put their tables outside. All right, coming up next, the media tries to pin the COVID-19 death toll on Donald Trump. Stay with us on THE FIVE.

So I think her question about does a president like you deserve to be re-elected was sort of geared towards where she is thinking and where she is spending her time.

Can I speak to the Dr. Birx thing for a second? Way to stand up for women, ladies, I mean, wow. OK, Joy Behar, first of all, she's trying to look like Dr. Birx with the scarf.

', ""GUTFELD: Well, this is the environment. It's the gotcha question game show. But I want to tie what Olivia Nuzzi and the Birx thing have in common. So Nuzzi's question is the perfect example of media narcissism. The question by its very nature is guaranteeing attention back to the person asking the question. I'm sure she got DM's (ph) from Acosta and the bald guy, saying, wow, that was really amazing what you did to her. "", ""But the question itself is absurd. Do you deserve to be re-elected? Well, that's what the election will determine, you moron. And you can put it like -- let's put it this way. Given the tornado hit your town and killed 30 people, do you deserve to be dogcatcher? That's exactly how stupid her question was. Now, when you focus on Brix (ph), OK? It's called the contamination effect. "", ""The media loves to just soil her reputation, because by -- if you are hanging around somebody we hate, Trump, then you are contaminated, right? They transfer the hate to her. So what about the people that Birx knows, right? Are they contaminated by now knowing her? You see how this thing works? They should do trace -- whatever they call it, contact tracing on everybody's friendships. "", 'So lastly, why do these things have something in common? The media is hypocritically evil. They think that when they interview unsavory people, they are imparting their good moral fiber on them. So when they question Trump, they are actually the moral high ground, which is why Nuzzi had her absurd question. But when you, like Birx is among Trump, then you are the recipient of the unsavory-ness of Trump, right? ', ""Then you are now immoral by being around him. So you see the trick. The media gets to decide who gets to impart moral value. And it's always them, but it's never you. "", ""WATTERS: That's a good point. Juan, what do you think? "", ""WILLIAMS: I think the press is supposed to hold powerful people accountable and ask questions. Now, I think President Trump is never shy, never shy about saying, hey, that's a crazy question, or that an unfair question, or that's a fake news question. But in this instance, he didn't do that. He treated it seriously. And as Dana pointed out, he gave what I think was a pretty good answer from his perspective. "", ""He said the numbers are less than what had been projected, and then tried to take credit for it, so that's what he did. And by the way, I don't think it's a -- it was a gotcha question.

He has floated the idea or conspiracy theory, really that President Trump is going to postpone the election. The president pushed back -- the president is not going to postpone the election. The election will be held in November. "", 'He rolled out this Hillary endorsement, which I think was probably scheduled from a long time ago, because what a day to roll it out.

', ""PERINO: It's -- I thought I'd give a little bit of perspective just to set this up, because in a way all of us sort of feel like it's Groundhog's Day. It's been about four weeks now that we've been doing the show remotely, at least I have from here. "", 'And last Friday was the end of the week of which Jerome Adams, the surgeon general had said that this is going to be our Pearl Harbor moment, that was when we had hopefully reaching the apex and the peak. This week we are talking about the reopening. And we have some guidance. Some of it is vague because the states are going to have to decide based on their different criteria.

I see a roadmap and you are allowed to drive it. What drives me crazy is that if Trump had taken more command over this. Instead, this is what you're going to do, they would've accused him of being autocratic, a dictator and a tyrant. "", ""So, what does he do? He shares the responsibility with the governors. He says here's the road map, you drive the car. And now he is accused of punting by Joe Biden? Are you serious? It is so pathetic. "", ""And then I predicted this yesterday, I said that Pelosi wasn't going to say anything until after the plan is revealed because she did not want any skin in this game. She preferred to get stand in front of her double wide refrigerator and suck down ice cream until she gets an ice cream headache than actually offer practical advice. "", ""You know, you can sit on a fence and you could, you know, crap on people doing the job when you are out of power, that make sense. But at this point, it's just so obvious and so sad. In this situation, people's lives are going to, there is going to be death. Because every path that we choose is going to have death.

So, to sit there and go like, it's vague and inconsistent, you're just an idiot. Pure and simple, stick to your ice cream. "", ""PERINO: That's of course, Pelosi. And I think that we have a couple of Trump tweets today and then a Cuomo sound bite. If you could pull those up those Trump tweets so I could read those for folks who are maybe listening on the radio. "", ""So, President Trump tweeted this morning that Governor Cuomo should spend more time doing and less time complaining. Get out there and get the job done. Stop talking. We built you thousands of hospital beds that you didn't need or use, gave large numbers of ventilators that you should have had and helped you with. "", ""Let's see there's a little bit more, testing that you should be doing. We have given New York far more money, help, and equipment than any other state by far, and these great men and women who did the job never hear you say thanks. Your numbers are not good. Less talk and more action. "", ""I think he does say thank you a lot quite a bit to the healthcare workers, but Governor Cuomo decided to respond. We have a sound bite of that. Let's listen. "", '(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ', ""CUOMO: First of all, if he is sitting home watching TV, maybe he should get up and go to work, right? Second, the -- let's keep emotion and politics out of this and personal ego if we can, because this is about the people. It is about our job. And let's try to focus on that. "", '(END VIDEO CLIP) ', ""PERINO: All right, Juan, I'll let you take a whack at this one. "", 'JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS HOST: Well, you know, I hate to see us get political about this. I mean, I think that we need to work together. And I would hope that, you know, sometimes the president loves to be celebrated and thanked and all of that. OK. ', ""So, Cuomo then fires back. I don't -- I'm not sure it takes as much of anywhere. But I will say this. In terms of the plan, Dana, to me, I feel like everybody has got cabin fever. "", ""We know about the high unemployment numbers. Everybody wants to get out and get back to work but we have to be careful. We can't let sort of emotions that, you know, drive us, and impatience, because if we don't have testing, if we don't have contact tracing, then we can get ourselves in a very difficult situation where we put our workers, the people going back to work at a very high level of risk, and we put all of their customers, the people they come into contact with, work with -- "", 'PERINO: Yes. ', ""WILLIAMS: -- also at risk. Then we can find ourselves in a worse situation. So I think when you hear people say, we'd like to know how to deal with that, and we'd like the federal government's help, I think in terms of specifics, what Schumer was talking about, even what you heard from Governor Cuomo in terms of, OK, if you lay out a plan, give us some of the resources to make it work, I think that's what people are saying. I don't think it has to necessarily become sort of -- "", 'PERINO: All right. ', 'WILLIAMS: -- something nasty and divisive and finger-pointing. ', ""PERINO: Got it. And actually, Katie, I saw -- there were lots of different governors on the -- Greg is laughing, but I'll just keep going. Lots of different governors on the shows today talking about how they are working in coordination with the federal government and they're trying to figure out their own road map. So, there is the Colorado governor, the Alaska governor, Ohio, and all of these states have a little bit of a different situation on their hands. "", ""PAVLICH: Which is exactly why the president has said it's up to you guys, do what you want with this plan, it's going to be in phases, different places with a lower density population. They are going to have a different project and process moving forward on this. "", ""But it's interesting to watch what's happening here in D.C. or not in D.C. where lawmakers are at home. You have Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi criticizing this plan, and continually saying that you have to be careful, you have to make sure the economy isn't open too quickly. "", ""Well, when they are sitting there at home and not refilling the paycheck protection plan with or program, and not coming up with any other ideas about how to get people some economic health while they continue to advocate for the economy to be close, it's really easy to do that. "", ""And it's also easy to do that when you are getting a paycheck. And the bottom line, I think for people who are getting cabin fever as one said, is they want to be able to make their own decisions about their own risk. "", 'At this point they understand a lot more about the virus than we did two months ago, and they understand what precautions they need to take to not get sick, but they really want to be able to do that on their own without being dictated to by the government. ', 'PERINO: All right, Jesse, let me give you the last word here. ', ""JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS HOST: Well, I mean, if Democrats have a problem with the plan, take it up with Fauci and Birx. They are the experts that signed off on it. And then there's Cuomo, everybody on the left loves him they want him to run for president, so President Trump gives him free power and they say, he can't handle it, he can't do it by himself all of a sudden. "", ""Cuomo is complaining about not getting the resources, he just donated hundreds of ventilators to other states because he had overcapacity. Because the president gave him so many. They just built hospital in Long Island they haven't even used it yet. "", ""So, I would stop complaining already before the president has even given you any additional resources. This -- the country is viewing this from two different perspectives. There are people that are better off, that are kind of having a little fun, may be working from home, they are still getting paid. They are zooming, you know, they are doing their thing, they're cooking. And then there's people that can't afford to work from home. "", ""They don't have a job. They have lost a business which had been in their family for generations. And they're dying to get back to work. And one side doesn't understand the other side. You know, how could you not want to protect the health? What about if it spreads further? "", 'And then the other side is saying, wait a second, you guys understanding my position, I need to work to feed my family. Or else, this is it for me. And they are talking across of each other, and a lot of it has to do with New York. ', ""The state of New York has 225,000 cases. New Jersey has 75,000 cases. Combined that's 300,000 virus cases. The next biggest state that has that case is like 30,000 in Massachusetts. Other states like Wyoming, North Dakota, Hawaii, Vermont, West Virginia, they have a couple hundred cases. "", ""And so, to say that to New York should open up at the same rate as Vermont which has like a handful of cases is stupid. Everybody knows that's stupid. But they are trying to attack the president for politics. And that's just wrong. "", ""PERINO: All right. Good discussion, guys. Coming up next, protests continue to rage across the country against strict stay-at-home orders which we were just kind of just talking about. Stay tuned. We'll tell you more. "", '(COMMERCIAL BREAK) ', ""WATTERS: Protests are spreading across the country against strict stay-at- home orders, breaking out in states like Michigan, Kentucky, Virginia, and Minnesota. They're calling on governors to roll back what they say are the more arbitrary and restrictive measures. "", 'Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer is facing at least two federal lawsuits over her stay-at-home order which includes a ban on visits to friends or relatives. And protesters they are getting no sympathy from liberal View HOST Joy Behar. She mocked their concerns with this comment. ', '(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ', ""JOY BEHAR, ABC HOST: Well, I would like to ask them if they are willing to sign away their right to treatment if and when they get affected. Are you going to say, OK, I don't need a ventilator, because I thought that I should go out and defy the governor's order? "", '(END VIDEO CLIP) ', ""WATTERS: All right, Katie, you mentioned the other day about some sort of regulation they had in Michigan they can't buy seeds to grow food. I heard another one today, if you live in Detroit or something like that and you have a summer home outside in the suburbs or something, you can't leave Detroit and go stay at your second residence. It's crazy. "", ""PAVLICH: Right. It's ridiculous and it's very personal for these people. And I don't really understand what Joy Behar is saying. "", ""First of all, we've been able to buy some time with getting the hospitals ready and the equipment and beds that they need to handle the situation moving forward, but also what she says is like driving a car and getting a car accident and then saying that you're not allowed to go to the hospital because you got in an accident and made the choice to go do that. "", ""I think that people are smart enough to make their own decisions about understanding the risk. They understand if they don't want to get sick, they don't have to go out, but they don't want to be told that they can't do basic things like garden on their own property. That's the first thing. "", 'The second thing is, you know, in this new plan, one of the things that stuck out to me and the road map that the White House put out is elective surgeries in phase one will now be allowed to resume. That I think is such a crucial point, because elective surgery includes biopsies for cancer detection. ', ""I've heard from doctors who have said they were unable to operate on their breast cancer patients at this point. I mention our family friend who has a collapsed lung. And just think about how much damage that is doing to people's health and mental health as a result of not being able to get to the healthcare that they need in those circumstances. "", ""So, there are consequences to all of these things. I don't think that they are all arbitrary. But in Michigan they certainly have been, which is why you are seeing people say enough is enough, I'm essential, it's essential to feed my family and provide for myself. I make my own decisions. "", ""WATTERS: Yes, Greg, I heard another regulation that they have up there in Michigan, you are allowed to kayak, but you can't go out in a motorboat. Figure that one out for me. "", ""GUTFELD: I can't. I can't. I just want to point out that Joe -- Joy -- Joy makes a fabulous living as a feminist bozo the clown, so she doesn't understand the need to make money or the need to work. She just shows up and spouts whatever. "", ""We trust our leaders until they push their luck. And what happened was you had a governor, micro micromanaging in kind of an arbitrary fashion. I mean, you can't buy seeds, but you can buy pot. "", ""I remember when I was young, you would buy pot and all you got were seeds. So, the protests aren't -- "", 'WATTERS: Yes. ', ""GUTFELD: -- the protests aren't about staying at home. They are more about the kind of the arbitrary micromanagement. One more thing, you know, she pointed out that she saw Swastikas at the rally, and she didn't -- and she did. I think she did see them, but there is a distinction. The protesters were comparing her actions to fascist dictators. "", ""It wasn't that there were Nazis there, it was that they were unfairly. They were unfairly comparing her to Hitler, which is wrong. But one should make that distinction, because what she was saying was that there was Nazis there because she saw Swastikas. "", 'WATTERS: Greg, what the heck is on your shirt by the way? ', ""GUTFELD: This is a legendary misfit's shirt, but it's got a mask on it. Isn't it awesome? It's an icon. "", 'WATTERS: OK. ', ""GUTFELD: I got it from Jerry Only. I'm glad you ask. "", ""WATTERS: I got it. All right. I'm glad I -- I'm not sure I'm glad I did. "", 'Dana Perino, you mentioned the other day about the governor of Michigan, she was kind of on a short-list to be V.P., may have mishandled that opportunity to kind of show her strength as a governor. She now says she is going to have a plan to reopen next week. Is it too late for her? ', 'PERINO: Well, it might be too late for her to be on the V.P. short-list, because I think that, you know, that debut -- ', 'WATTERS: Yes. ', ""PERINO: -- was not so good. And I think what happened is she got caught up in the national political currents, and now she'll be swept out to sea. There are other examples though of governors who have done a pretty good job of ignoring the national politics and avoiding that and speaking very clearly to their states. "", ""I think Governor Charlie Baker up in Massachusetts is one of them. I put Governor Polis of Colorado in that basket as well. It doesn't mean they won't have protests of people complaining about the lockdowns. "", ""But I do think that from a governor standpoint, that leadership, when you are looking to see who is doing a good job and who isn't, you can compare those governors to somebody like Governor Northam in Virginia who all of a sudden today said, OK, or yesterday said we're going to be lockdown till June 10th. But didn't give any more reasons or data or explanations. "", 'And this idea that Katie was just talking about, about elective surgeries. There are a lot of hospitals across the country that are desperate for patients. They are running out of money. And Nancy Pelosi and Schumer say that they want to hold up the money for the small businesses because they want to help the hospital. ', ""Well, one of the ways to help the hospitals would be allow the governors to make that decision to allow for hospitals that can handle it to do these elective surgeries. Then you won't have to give them so many taxpayer dollars in order to take care of their short fall. "", ""WATTERS: That's a really good point. Juan, bring it home for us. "", 'WILLIAMS: By the way, I just want to underline what Dana just said, because you know, I know some doctors in my family. And again, the hospitals are struggling. And people who do need to have the elective surgeries. In some cases, they have to let doctors who are not in the emergency rooms and the like, they have to lay them off or put them on leave for a while, because they are not getting the income from those surgeries. ', ""Over all, though, I would say, you know, I don't want to see this become a big political fight. And the thing with these rallies, you know, the president tweeting today, liberate Minnesota. Liberate Michigan, and the flags at the rally, they're Trump flags, it makes it seem so political. "", ""And I think people are right to sometimes say to government, don't be intrusive. You know, don't step on my rights. We are going to act together. And America has acted together in terms of social distancing, in terms of the hand washing, everything to lower the curve. "", ""So, we don't want to give that up just suddenly and without reason. I think you've got to give some leeway to elected officials who are looking out for the public's health. But you -- I don't think we want to politicize this so that, certain people think this way, certain people -- no, let's not do that with this. "", 'This is too important and too deadly. I was shocked. Shocked, Jesse, to see it was 2,200 people, I think died in America yesterday, and 2,500 on Wednesday. Over 33,000 Americans dead as a result of this. This is serious business. ', 'WATTERS: I would agree with you, Juan, we do not want to see this politicize. ', ""Coming up, it's basket of deplorables all over again, may be. Joe Biden's attack on Trump voters is next. "", '(COMMERCIAL BREAK) ', 'WILLIAMS: Welcome back. ', ""The Trump campaign is accusing Joe Biden of a deplorables moment, just like what happened with Hillary Clinton's famous remark, or infamous remark, I should say, in 2016. "", ""The presumptive Democratic nominee, Biden, was talking about Trump supporter's when he said this. There are people who support the president because they like the fact that he is engaged in the politics of division. They really support the notion that, you know, all Mexicans are rapists, and all Muslims are bad, dividing this nation based on ethnicity and race. "", ""So, Jesse, I thought I'd come to you and just ask the obvious question, I mean, isn't it true that the president can say some divisive, polarizing things? "", ""WATTERS: Yes, but so do Democrats, it's a wash. It's politics. It doesn't really bother me that much. The point is this, Juan. Joe Biden is supposed to be the Democratic that can win over disaffected Trump supporter's in places like Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. The white working-class men and women of this country. "", ""That's his whole appeal. And then he goes and says something like this. He is supposed to be the guy. Yes, Mitch McConnell is going to work with me when I get in there. I'm going to restore dignity and civility and honor and that kind, and then he goes and says this. "", ""Do I think it's the same thing as the basket of deplorables with Hillary? No, but it's not good. And he just hasn't had a great run since this started. He botched the travel ban. It took two weeks for them to set up a home camera in his library. Then when they did get the feed up, he was -- couldn't communicate effectively. Then he got hit with a sexual assault allegation, and now this. it's like, you know, he's not performing well in a time when, you know, you're either a prime time player you're not. "", ""WILLIAMS: That's a fair point. So Katie, I think from the Joe Biden perspective, people think, oh, Joe Biden is supposed to be a guy who's calm and a healer and more empathetic, but I don't think that he would play to the way -- I don't think he plays the Trump game, which Trump has played to obvious success. "", ""PAVLICH: Juan, one look at Joe Biden's history shows that he's not a guy who has a long temper, that someone who is -- not someone who doesn't want to fight in political battles. I mean, Joe Biden is not a very nice guy when it comes to the political game. And he's been portrayed as such to kind of rewrite his own history and record, but he's not that kind of person. "", ""The reason why you have Donald Trump sitting in the White House, the big reason is because people got very sick of the political correctness garbage, of being accused of being a racist just because you disagreed with some kind of policy. If you want to close borders or more border security, you didn't like -- you were xenophobic and didn't like immigrants for some reason. That was pushed aside. "", ""And for Joe Biden to now alienate those voters that, as Jesse pointed out, he needs shows that again, his campaign keeps throwing things up against the wall, and nothing is sticking. If that's the final argument that you're trying to make, you're losing. "", ""WILLIAMS: So, Dana, I was just struck by the idea that -- I don't know that Joe Biden really could win voters who are hardcore Trump supporters at this point. The Trump's base has never really gone away. They're there around 40, 45 percent in all the polls I see. "", ""PERINO: Yes, it's got an uphill battle. But remember, he was the one that said that if you are an Obama-Trump voter, that his pitch was that he could win those people back. And this kind of language is obviously not going to do that. "", ""It's also strange to me that, you know, he was the person that was going to be able to appeal to the lunch pail crowd. And a weak nominee would try to continue to win over his base over and over again, a strong nominee would start to veer to the middle. And he's not doing that right now. "", ""So -- I also saw that somebody suggesting that Elizabeth Warren really would be a good nominee for him. He doesn't need to pick her as his VP. He already got her endorsement. She didn't win her own state. She probably couldn't win a single -- help him win a single battleground state. I mean, I don't think -- that one, you could probably just cross off your list. "", 'WILLIAMS: So Greg, I think that everybody is saying the president is the president in terms of how he acts, how he behaves. I mean, he, he goes after Democrats, he goes after the Mexicans.

', ""GUTFELD: No, he was after -- he was talking about criminals, illegal immigrants who are criminals, but that's OK. What you're conflating, and I understand this, is that what Trump does, he actually goes after a person. The problem with what Hillary did and what Joe Biden does is they go after the people. "", ""You can go after the person, but when you go after the people, it looks really, really bad. By the way, to Dana's point about Liz Warren endorsing Biden, is that kind of interesting that she was the woman who absolutely destroyed Bloomberg, who would have been a better candidate over sexual harassment, but then just adores the guy who's being accused of sexually assaulting a woman. I think that's pretty amazing. "", 'WATTERS: Good point. ', 'GUTFELD: But back to the -- back to the original point. I wonder how many blacks did Joe Biden and Kamala Harris put behind bars versus how many blacks Donald Trump released with prison reform? That would be an interesting survey.

Yesterday, I took a professional FaceTime call and I didn't have a shirt on. And the guy at the other end was like Watters, what are you doing? And I just said -- I just didn't ever shirt on.

Has anyone checked your local like nudist camp to see if there's -- if they're actually wearing masks. Are they keeping their distance? I think this is worthy of a primetime Bret Baier investigation. Bear at all with Bret Baier. "", ""PAVLICH: So Juan, you're in a suit and tie, but what is your regular apparel during the day?

', ""PERINO: I can imagine that the school districts are just trying to figure out what in the world are they going to do. I don't necessarily think that just giving everybody an A is the answer. I think maybe just giving everybody, you know, an X and basically saying we're going to not count this, or if they have been able to complete online schoolwork and the teachers are satisfied with it, great accordingly if possible. But I don't envy these teachers and school districts or the parents who are really trying so hard to keep up with the studies for their kids as well as doing their jobs at home.

I'm saying, there's got to be massive grade inflation right now, because if you're taking the test at home, you're either getting your parents to help you or you're cheating.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. ', 'NEIL CAVUTO, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Thank you, Bill. ', ""It's the warning that has everybody talking. What did he mean? What did the CDC director mean about maybe a more virulent strand of this coming later? "", ""This as protests heat up in Richmond, Virginia, among a half-dozen other cities and states today that were dealing with a shutdown, with which they have had enough. We're going to be up on those protests, but first on what the CDC director meant when he told The Washington Post that there's a distinct possibility that a second stronger virus could be coming our way by the end of the year. "", 'The latest from CDC headquarters, Jonathan Serrie there in Atlanta -- Jonathan. ', 'JONATHAN SERRIE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Neil. ', ""The CDC director's concern is over the potential timing of this second wave. Although the coronavirus vaccine is probably still going to be a year away, Director Robert Redfield is urging Americans to get flu shots once they become available, shots against seasonal flu. "", ""And here's why. Dr. Robert Redfield tells The Washington Post a second wave of COVID-19 may appear in the winter, just as flu season is ramping up. And so you would have hospitals dealing with two outbreaks of major respiratory illnesses at the same time. "", 'So, if people get vaccinated against flu, and fewer people get sick from flu, that will presumably preserve precious hospital resources for the coronavirus response. ', 'Also, federal health officials say testing and monitoring by then will be improved. ', '(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ', ""DR. DEBORAH BIRX, WHITE HOUSE CORONAVIRUS RESPONSE COORDINATOR: We're also hoping, by that time, that we have additional treatment options for people with COVID-19, so that there will be additional treatment available in the fall.

"", ""CAVUTO: Jonathan, I'm curious now, just to be clear, on the CDC director and what he said or didn't say. "", 'Robert Redfield had made these comments in a Washington Post interview about a second wave. Kayleigh McEnany, the White House press secretary, claims the media took him out of context. Donald Trump earlier on had said that it was fake news, again, assuming that that was taken out of context. ', ""But from the director himself, there's been no clarification. So what are we to make of that? "", ""SERRIE: Yes, and I don't think any clarification is needed. "", ""I think federal health officials are all in agreement that COVID-19 may very likely be a seasonal illness. And so it would be a no-brainer that, if it reappears in the fall, or in the winter, coinciding with flu season, that's going to be a huge burden on the hospital. "", 'And so it would be sound public health practice to advise people, once seasonal flu shots for next season become available, to go out there and get those shots. ', ""Now, I think some people may have interpreted his comments in a different way, as possibly contradicting the administration. That's not the way I read it. To me, it just seems like good, sound public health advice, Neil. "", 'CAVUTO: In other words, to look for the potential of something that could happen. You might be right. ', 'And to clarify that -- and, Jonathan, thank you very, very much. ', 'Redfield had warned of a second wave of coronavirus this winter, and that it could potentially -- the key word there being potentially -- be even more difficult than the one we just went through. ', ""Now, many, many agree that, if there is a more virulent strain or an emergence of another wave, that that is always the possible case, the potential case. So, we might be just sort of parsing words here and nuances, but it did have a lot of people talking as to whether we might be easing up on things just as there's the distinct possibility, the potential for something coming down the road. "", 'I want to discuss this in more detail with Dr. Nasia Safdar, the University of Wisconsin health medical director of infection control. ', 'Doctor, thanks for taking the time. ', ""It seems to me that the CDC director -- and I parsed this and these interview comments of The Washington Post every which way to Friday, and I don't think he was saying anything that wasn't out there in the public domain of a possibility, that there's a possibility something emerges in the fall and the winter. "", 'Do you agree with that possible premise? ', 'DR. NASIA SAFDAR, MEDICAL DIRECTOR OF INFECTION CONTROL, UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN HOSPITAL: I do agree with that premise. ', ""Most seasonal respiratory viruses will have a seasonal predilection. So I don't think it's outside the realm of possibility to think that there will be a second wave coming. "", ""CAVUTO: So, when we do see second waves, Doctor -- I know it's infrequent, but in situations like this, do you change your thinking about how you unwind out of this one, unwind out of the social distancing provisions and other, you know, orders that are in place in scores of states, most states in this country? "", 'SAFDAR: I think what you have to do is realizing this is going to be a marathon, and not a sprint. ', ""I think that you have to start thinking about very carefully and slowly easing up on the social distancing measures, realizing that it's a little bit like letting the genie out of the bottle. You want to be able to be in a place where you can push it back in if you have to. "", 'And to willy-nilly open up everything at the same time is likely to be fraught with problems. ', 'CAVUTO: Doctor, we hear of among the things they want to look for is a decline in hospitalizations, a continued improvement, not only in the report of new cases, but even in the more lagging indicator, the report of deaths, as well as more testing. ', ""That's a lot of things to check off before going through this unwinding. What would you like to see? "", ""SAFDAR: I think you have to make sure that there's a very robust public health infrastructure in place. "", ""With all this effort that we have gone to, to try and stop the transmission of this virus, it would be a shame to let it now unwind to the point where we can't keep it in check anymore. So, having the hospital infrastructure, the public health contact tracing, the testing to be able to accomplish all that is really critical to success. "", 'CAVUTO: So, with these antibody tests that can be far more sweeping, and you get an idea of maybe an alarming increase in cases or potential cases, what would that tell you? ', 'SAFDAR: I think what an antibody test would tell us, what proportion of the population has been infected. ', ""I don't think we're at the point right now where we can say that there's a certain protective level of antibody and what that level is, suggesting that people may not get reinfected. I don't think we have those answers yet. "", 'CAVUTO: Doctor, thank you very, very much. ', 'I know we peppered you with a lot of questions based on some of this breaking news. We appreciate your patience as well, Dr. Nasia Safdar. ', 'All right, right now, I just want to take you to the corner of Wall and Broad. You might notice a very big run-up today in the Dow. ', 'A lot of that had to do with the fact that oil prices were jumping again. I know we live in an upside-down, topsy world, but the fact of the matter is, we had seen stops careen on the belief that oil was going to negative prices here. We adjusted that. They did come back a little bit here. ', 'But the fact of the matter is, we are still at and in and out of record lows for a barrel of oil, today costing you a little bit more than $13 a barrel.

KEVIN STITT (R-OK): Well, you're right. "", ""I mean, it's been a double whammy for our state. One in five jobs are related directly or indirectly to the oil and gas industry.

"", ""It's just kind of been the perfect storm for our state right now. So, we're looking at the CARES Act and some of those federal stimulus packages to help all of our industries in Oklahoma.

And we rolled out a three-phased reopening plan, a very measured reopening plan, because the intent of my 15 executive orders was to flatten the curve and to build capacity in our hospitals.

And, today, we have 298 people across the state in the hospitals with COVID- related symptoms. "", ""So, we feel good right now. We're going to be data-driven. And we're going to do a measured phase one, two and three reopening starting this Friday, and then again May 1 with some other things. And we will move to phase two, as long as the data and the trends continue to be flattened. "", 'CAVUTO: Are you at all dissuaded by the CDC director warning about, and I must stress, the potential of a second wave that could come in the fall or the winter? A lot of doctors tell me that that is not such an earth- shattering statement. ', ""It's just one of those possibilities that happen with a situation like this. But it did raise possibilities that, just as we're getting out of this virus and all the issues attached to it, we might have another potentially more dangerous one down the road. "", 'Does that affect how you calibrate your decisions? ', 'STITT: Well, sure. It goes into the decision-making. ', ""But I told Oklahomans today that coronavirus is in the United States. It's in Oklahoma. And just because we're going to do a measured reopening of our economy, it doesn't mean that we can stop social distancing, that we don't have to continue with some of these practices, sanitation, washing the hands, continuing the social distancing practices, because we know it's here. "", ""We know more people are going to get cases. That's why we have to watch the data. And, right now, the data in Oklahoma is -- is flattening. And that's exactly what we wanted to do and wanted to accomplish. We are built -- we have 15 times the hospital beds that we need. "", ""And so we feel good. We're obviously going to continue to watch it. And we will reserve the freedom to back up on some of these loosening if we -- if we see the trends move in the other direction.

NICOLE SAPHIER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, of course, when you hear the CDC director say that it -- we could be seeing this again next season, it could be even worse than it is right now, people are panicking, because we have millions of people out of work right now. ', 'We have tens of thousands of death with COVID-19. So, it is scary. So we have to break it down a little bit. And it can really be broken down by looking at the numbers. ', ""During a normal flu season, from August to the following May, you can have 400,000 to 700,000 people go into the hospital because of the flu. And that's about the estimate that we saw this year alone. And, right now, in just the last two-and-a-half months, we have had over 100,000 people hospitalized with COVID-19. "", ""That is why we had to have makeshift beds in Central Park and on ships, because we had a lot of people already in the hospital already from the flu. So we didn't have enough room for those COVID-19 patients, and not to mention the flu, but all of the chronic illnesses that America suffers from. "", 'And we have seen in just -- JAMA just this week posted an article that said over 95 percent of people who either died or had COVID-19, the severity of the illness, had coexisting comorbidities, or preexisting illnesses, which kind of renders us vulnerable. ', ""So, when we're talking about next season, sometimes, these viral infections can die out, and we don't really see a resurgence in them. But this is a very highly -- very contagious virus. And so the chance of it dying out just after this one round is probably low. "", ""So it's likely going to be here next season. So, instead of just cold and flu season, it's probably going to be cold, flu and corona season. "", ""But the good news is, Neil, that there are some things that we can do to make us more prepared for it, so that we aren't shut down, the way that we are right now. And you already alluded to some of them. "", ""One of the biggest things we can do is actually getting the flu shot. Less than 40 percent of adults actually get the flu shot. But if you do get the flu shot, not only are you protecting yourself and those around you from the flu, but now you're keeping hospital beds open for those that may need it because of COVID-19. "", ""So that is why they keep saying, you should get the flu shot. And if you're elderly or have chronic lung disease, you should also get the pneumonia vaccine. "", ""But I am actually really optimistic, Neil, because I think everyone has a much greater awareness right now of washing their hands and not touching their face. And all of a sudden, people really look at people find me if someone's sneezing or coughing, and that's OK, especially during cold and flu season. "", ""CAVUTO: No, you're right about that. "", 'SAPHIER: So, I actually think Americans are going to come out a lot stronger after all of this. ', ""CAVUTO: Well, I hope so. And I think you're right. "", ""I do wonder, on the flu shot, it might be a dumb question, but if I had one earlier this year, Doctor, and now I'm hearing the CDC making a recommendation, and you just making a recommendation to get a flu shot at the end of this year, is that one too many? Or what are you saying? "", 'SAPHIER: So, actually, the recommendation, Neil, is that you a flu shot once a year, once a season. ', ""But, usually, we say try and get that flu shot towards the end of summer, early into the fall, because flu season does actually start in August. So, the best time to get it is around that time. And it's supposed to last the whole season, as long as it is. "", ""But we have to remember that we saw 400,000 to 700,000 hospitalizations from the flu, but we did actually see a decrease in flu hospitalizations, since everybody's been hunkering down at home. So the possibility is, we could have had a lot more hospitalizations from the flu, had we just allowed people out right now. "", ""Here's the big concern for me, Neil, is that we tend to see a flu spike in December. That is when most people are at home. That is when there's a lot of gatherings for the holidays, families getting together, a lot of travel happening. "", ""So, if we also have COVID-19 virus circulating during that time, we're going to see a lot of community spread. So I think we have to be really smart in how we handle holiday season this year. I don't want everybody to have to be doing it digitally. But I think we have to be a lot smarter as to what we're doing, especially while we still have this novel coronavirus circulating, and we don't have proven treatments or a vaccine yet.

Sometime before the end of the day, the president expected to sign an executive order which would put an initial 60-day pause on certain types of green cards.

He wants to prevent new people from coming into the country and taking jobs that he believes should go to people who are in the country already as the nation begins to reopen, and, as well, he wants to protect access for Americans to the health care system.

', ""Now, we just got some information about how this is all going to work. It's going to prevent the entry of new green card holders from abroad. What it basically does is, it puts diversity lottery green cards, work green cards and chain migration hold. "", ""And you will remember, these were all things the president wanted to do through legislation. This doesn't affect people who will come into the country temporarily or people who are already in the country in the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services program.

We're at a time where the American worker must come first. "", '(END VIDEO CLIP) ', ""ROBERTS: Well, that wasn't President Trump, but she speaks for President Trump.

"", ""WALLACE: You're like a lot of governors, Governor DeWine, in the sense that you're taking hits from both sides. On the one hand, you're -- you're getting criticism that you're reopening too fast. There's a hot spot in Marion, Ohio, where the -- the cases per capita is actually higher than New York City. The mayor of Dayton is pushing back saying they don't have the testing and the contact tracing. So you're taking a hit on that side. "", ""But you're also taking a hit from conservatives, frankly, a lot of people in your own party, that you're moving too slowly. There have been a number of protests in the streets against you -- you and your -- your stay-at-home order saying let's move faster. And the state house of representatives in Ohio, in Columbus, just voted to take away your ability, your authority to issue a stay-at-home order that exceeds two weeks.

We can't underestimate the workers who don't have jobs. And so that's why we have to move forward, but we have to move forward very, very carefully. And -- and my message to my fellow Ohioans has always been, we can do two things at once, but we can only do them if we're very, very careful about it. "", ""And so our future, our ability to open up Ohio is going to depend with whether people continue to do the social distancing literally. Do they continue -- do they -- will they wear masks when they go out in public. I mean we now have -- for example, every business that opens, unless there's some reason that they cannot do that, their employees have to wear masks.

When they go out, do they go out, do what they have to do, and then -- and then come back. So we can't stop doing that as -- as we move forward. "", ""We would love to see the numbers go down. We think we're at about a 1:1 -- one person infecting one person. We would love to get those numbers down below that. But what we don't want to see is it dramatically go up from -- from where it is.

How tough would that be to say, you know what, we're going to reinstitute the stay-at-home order and we're going to have to tell businesses that we've just opened, you've got to close, if that's what happens?

President Trump is kindling to that and President Trump, one way or the other, I think, wants Michael Flynn set loose.

That double standard is not lost on the American people and I think has political ramifications as well.

', 'Three weeks ago, 39-year-old Danny Lemos of Nebraska was diagnosed with COVID-19. He believes he got it from his dad who works at a beef plant.

"", ""LEMOS: He's definitely on the uphill climate thing, so. "", ""MACCALLUM: Good. Well, that's good news. We're glad to hear it. Why do you - why are you so against with what the governor is deciding to do, given the fact that only 70 people have died in Nebraska and there are very - can you hear me OK, Danny? "", 'LEMOS: I can, I hear you now. ', ""MACCALLUM: You can hear me now? All right, so we're going to try to reestablish our connection with Danny. Sometimes it's a bit tricky. But let's go over and talk to the Nebraska Governor, Pete Ricketts, and then we'll come back to Danny if we can get his signal back. "", ""Governor, thank you, first of all, for being here tonight on The Story. We've been talking to a lot of the nation's governors on this show. Basically, there's a lot of concern about reopening, especially since Nebraska has some real hot spots that have been cropping up just over the past couple of weeks. And a number of people have died, particularly at these meatpacking and meat producing plants. So, what do you say to them and what do you say to Danny? "", ""PETE RICKETTS, NEBRASKA GOVERNOR: Well, hey, first of all, thank you very much for having me on, and we're very grateful for Mr. Lemos' recovery. So, that's a good thing. And I think what we've got to take a step back to a couple of months ago and remember is that every public health expert in the country said, look, you cannot stop this virus from coming. You can't even change the area under the curve, which means you can't stop people from getting infected because nobody's got immunity. "", ""What you can do is spread this out so that it doesn't overwhelm your health care system. And that's what we've accomplished with those - the steps we put in place here in Nebraska. So, we've flattened that curve. Everybody who's needed a ventilator has been able to get that ventilator. Everybody need hospital beds being able to get it. And so now what we've done is and the analogy I use is it's like we can end nearly every traffic death by taking the speed limit on the interstate down to five miles an hour. We don't do that. "", ""But that's essentially what we've done with our economy, with all these restrictions put in place. And it's been successful. It's worked. We haven't overwhelmed our health care system. We've got lots of capacity all across the state in Nebraska and especially in our metropolitan areas. "", ""Now, what we're going to do is gradually release these restrictions so that we can find what is that right speed where we can allow people to start returning to a somewhat normal life, but still make sure that we don't overwhelm the health care system that everybody, like Mr. Lemos can get access to that ventilator. "", ""MACCALLUM: Yes. So, the model show that you're still 11 days away from the peak in Nebraska. And that July 4th is when the models predict would be a good time to begin to make the changes that you are starting to put into place. And, you know, just to give you the words of one of your - one of the other politicians in Nebraska, Adam Morfeld, he is a Democrat. "", ""He thinks that it is too early. Says, I think we've gone from being medically informed to a political calculation and that's dangerous when we haven't even reached our peak. What do you say to that? Why not wait just a few more weeks? "", ""RICKETTS: Well, a couple of things. Bunch of good reasons. First of all, the data doesn't support waiting. If you look at Omaha, for example, we could probably take at least 10, if not 20 times the cases per day and still be well able to handle everything in our hospital system. So, we have plenty of capacity in our hospital system right now. "", ""Second thing I'd say is Dr. Khan, University of Nebraska Medical Center will tell you, models are not predictive. If you look at the IHME model, for example, it bounces all around every day from the state of Nebraska, and I'm sure other states as well. "", 'And the final thing and this goes back to, again, what we talked about with our experts two months ago is that the more you restrict the longer may people wait, more people are just going to break this quarantine anyway. ', ""So, Nebraskans have been very patient. They've made a lot of sacrifices and it has all worked. We've got to get back to, it's not about the cases. As we test more people, we're going to have more cases. That's just a fact. So, what we have to focus on the thing that doesn't change, which is how many people are going to the hospital. "", 'If we make sure we manage that we can make sure that we got our health care system00 ', 'MACCALLUM: Understood. And we have always put a lot more focus on hospitalizations than anything else, because the case number, the more you test, the more the case number will go up. But you have a particular situation at these meat plants and a concentration of cases and people who are getting sick, who work at them and complaints from some of the workers that there is plastic partitions that still have them only inches apart. ', ""And because there's not enough testing, comprehensive testing at these plants, you don't know if the guy or the woman next to you has it. And although there has been compensation increase - money and compensation to keep people coming. A lot of those individuals are very concerned about the work environment that they're in. And yet, as we understand it, the President wants to keep these meat processing plants open. Is that true? "", ""RICKETTS: Well, not only does the President want to keep them open, I want to keep them open. It's very important that we keep them open so that we can continue to have a strong food supply chain. And there's no doubt that the facilities are very difficult to do social distancing, as are the homes the people are coming from, because a lot of times they've got higher concentrations of people and multiple generations. So, we've got to take a community wide approach to be able to tackle this problem. And that's what we're doing. "", ""We're working with the food processors. I've been on the phone with them for weeks. We have a weekly phone call established. Our University of Nebraska Medical Center and their Global Center for Health Security has published a COVID-19 playbook, which is best practices for all the facilities. "", ""We're working with the facilities to do inspections or tours, to be able to help them do a better job on this, to do better social distancing. And we're also reaching out to the communities, through our health clinics, through trusted people in the community, to do better education around social distancing, testing, contact tracing. I do Spanish language briefings a couple of times a week to get the message out there. "", ""We've got videos now. We've translated in French, Spanish, Nepalese, Somali, Arabic, I mean, you get the idea. It's about reaching out to those communities and making sure that both at work and at home, we're doing a good job of social distancing. "", ""MACCALLUM: So, let me ask you this. I understand that the Smithfield factory wanted to shut down, but they reversed that decision because they were under pressure to stay open. Is that true? And what if people who work there don't feel comfortable going to work? Will they be able to get their unemployment benefits? "", ""RICKETTS: So, I don't know that anybody, or I don't know if anybody putting pressure on Smithfield. They called us in the morning, said they were going to close, they call back in the afternoon and said, they had changed that position. So, from that standpoint, I don't believe so. "", ""With regard to unemployment benefits, I mean, first of all, I think a lot of the plants and I don't know specifically with Smithfield, I think it's true for Smithfield, but I have to check my facts. But anyway, they're offering short-term disability for folks who have to stay home because they're sick. I know a lot of the plants are just paying people two weeks, pay time off if they're sick. So, they're really focusing on trying to get people to stay home where if one of their family members are staying home. "", ""And again, with regard to unemployment benefits, if you've got that doctor's note that says that you're sick and this is why you're staying home, yes, you'd be eligible for unemployment benefits as well. "", ""MACCALLUM: OK. But you can't stay home if you're concerned about being too close to the other people on the line since there are so many people who seem to be getting it, that doesn't qualify. "", ""RICKETTS: No, that actually doesn't qualify. You actually have to have a reason. The reason could be, you've got children home because school's out. The reason could be that you're staying home to take care of somebody else or somebody in your household is sick. Or the fact that you're sick obviously is a reason for you to stay home and collect these benefits. "", ""MACCALLUM: Right. OK, Governor Ricketts. Fair enough. Thank you for answering the questions and best of luck to you with your opening up. I know there's a lot of people who are anxious to see that happen, but obviously there's the commensurate concerns as well. So, thank you, Governor. Best of luck to you. "", 'RICKETTS: Thank you very much. ', 'MACCALLUM: All right, so I do think we have Danny Lemos back in communication with us. So, Danny, tell us a little bit about your thoughts and why - you hear what the governor is saying. He says, we have enough capacity to take care of people who get sick. We understand that the virus is taking its course. But he believes that there are places that can safely open up in your state. What do you say? ', ""LEMOS: Well, I mean, granted, there might be spaces to take care of these people, but just because you can take care of them doesn't mean they're going to live through it. You know, I mean, I literally was on my deathbed at one point and I was healthy with no under lending health issues. "", ""So, I don't know. It's just seems crazy to me. I know that this isn't any life to live as far as being stuck in your house, being quarantined all the time. So, I mean, something needs to be done. I don't know how you do it. I mean, we had what, 70 more cases today alone here in the Granite Island area. And then I think I read earlier that Georgia just reopened up and they had, what, 1000 cases within 24 hours. What can we do different? So, that we don't run into those issues. "", ""MACCALLUM: It's a good question. And you also have to ask, you know, is it going to spread to other communities because you've got these hot spots in Nebraska that are experiencing it right now? Before I let you go, I want to ask you, when I read in your story and said that you were given Remdesivir and you may have heard. I know you've been recovering that that drug is now received FDA approval. "", ""But it looked to me from what you said that you didn't feel like that made a difference in your case. And I'm just curious what your experience was. "", 'LEMOS: Well, I think the article that you read had a few things mixed up because that was absolutely a game changer in my recovery. 100 percent. ', 'MACCALLUM: Really, OK. ', ""LEMOS: There's no doubt. There's no doubt in my mind. Yes. There's no doubt in my mind, because within 48 hours of them treating me with that, with the first time, like I said, I'd pulled my vent out. I've got put on hyper oxygen. I was up walking around, eating with all my family. Everything like I went from being as low as I could get to feel like the man on the moon, like-- "", ""MACCALLUM: That's really encouraging. I'm glad I asked you about it, because that Remdesivir obviously is, you know, something that people are hopeful about at this point. Do you also think the fact that the doctors resisted putting you on a ventilator and gave you that hyper oxygen was also a positive factor in your recovery? "", ""LEMOS: Absolutely, I do. 100 percent, you know, and it's hard to say, but I think there's a reason I pulled my vent out, you know, who knows how long I would have been on it without me taking myself off of it. I guess, you know. I don't know how much of that played any of it. I'm here today and I'm thankful for that. "", 'MACCALLUM: Well, we are thankful to and I know your children are, and we wish you all the best, we hope your dad has a good recovery as well, Danny. So, thank you so much and thanks for hanging with us during the technical difficulties. Nice to have you with us tonight, sir. Be well. ', 'LEMOS: No problem. Thank you. ', ""MACCALLUM: You bet. Interesting. He said, Remdesivir was a big game changer for him, so we're going to follow that drug very closely. That's a bit of hopeful news. Up next, after New York's frantic scramble for hospital beds and ventilators, they built all these facilities. Hundreds of millions of dollars went into them. And now the state is facing some criticism for mismanagement. The former governor, George Pataki, joins us next with his story. "", '(COMMERCIAL BREAK) ', 'MACCALLUM: New concerns in New York tonight over waste and possible mismanagement after many things like ventilators and hospital beds and facilities went unused as the state battles COVID-19. ', 'FEMA is closing the Javits Center after reportedly treating 1000 patients in the 2500 bed facility in a month. And the USNS Comfort sailed out of New York after seeing few patients in terms of its capacity as well. ', 'Here now, former governor of New York, former New York Governor George Pataki joins me. Governor Pataki, always good to see you, sir. Thank you very much for joining tonight. ', 'GEORGE PATAKI, FORMER NEW YORK GOVERNOR: Thank you, Martha. ', ""MACCALLUM: Right. So, you know, obviously, it's good news that these facilities that were built weren't maxed out and overflowing. That would have been a complete nightmare for a city that has already endured the burden, the biggest burden of this. But it does raise questions about whether or not, you know, hundreds of millions of dollars went into building these facilities that were based on models that should not have been adhered to. "", ""PATAKI: Absolutely right, Martha. But it's not just about wasting money, as bad as that is. It's about losing lives. And I know Andrew Cuomo is one of the most popular politicians in America today. He has his briefings that are calm and informative. But when you look at the job that he is not doing when it comes to nursing homes, those beds should have been used to put the most vulnerable in those facilities. "", ""What happened in New York in my mind is a disgrace. The state directed nursing homes, and the one thing we know about this virus is the most vulnerable were the elderly. They directed that nursing homes take Coronavirus positive patients when they didn't have that protection, personal protective equipment. they didn't have the facilities. "", ""And as a consequence, we are approaching 4000 deaths in New York from nursing homes alone. Yes, they have wasted assets. Those positive patients should have been placed in the Javits Center or on the Comfort. They weren't. It's a failed policy and it's really sad for the people of New York, particularly those families who have lost loved ones. "", ""MACCALLUM: Yes, I mean, it's a policy that is just almost impossible to wrap your head around. There's one facility that has the Isabella Geriatric Center. They lost 98 people from that center. It's 14 percent of their total - in their total residents. "", ""And I don't understand - do you understand why Governor Cuomo didn't use, because we heard that the Comfort had been reconfigured so that it could accept COVID patients, they could have space them out and given everyone plenty of room on that ship. So, I can't even imagine if your family member - how you feel about the fact that they weren't sent there. "", ""PATAKI: Martha, New York's policies with nursing homes is incomprehensible. As you said, the Comfort had hundreds of beds waiting to take Coronavirus positive patients and the nursing homes were at the weakest of the age at the most vulnerable were put together, are required to take Coronavirus positive patients. "", ""It is an incomprehensible policy. And Martha. I think someone should look into it, not just the lost assets, but the policies that allowed nursing homes. First of all, not to get personal protective equipment. When asked whether he would help the nursing homes, the nurses, the orderlies, the people in those facilities, the governor said it's not his job. "", ""Well, in a crisis, it is his job to get personal protective equipment to everyone who is in need and then to demand that they take Corona positive patients. It's just senseless. So, we don't want this to happen again. Not in New York, not in any other state. Martha, we know there are going to be other health crises down the road, whether it's next year or next decade or the next generation. Someone should look into the misguided policies of Governor Cuomo with respect to New York's nursing homes, so that they never happen again. "", ""MACCALLUM: No. I mean, it's a tragedy and a lot of these bodies that we're seeing stories of in U halls, in Brooklyn are just atrocious. And given the amount of resources that were surged to New York City, it raises a lot of questions about how those resources were used. And one can't help but look at these conditions and ask, you know, do we not care because these people are of a certain age? Because that's an unacceptable answer. And the lives that could have been saved is a real factor. Not all of these people had to die in these nursing homes just because they're old. "", ""Governor Pataki, thank you. It's always good to see you, sir. "", 'PATAKI: Nice to see you, Martha. Stay well. ', ""MACCALLUM: All right, you too, be well. So, coming up next, newly released documents raise some serious questions about the FBI's handling of the Michael Flynn case, which we have documented here on The Story throughout the whole week. Trey Gowdy is very plugged in. I've been on this story since the very beginning. So, he's going to tell us what he thinks about what is now being revealed, which he was aware of. And why did Robert Mueller's team not report these documents? "", '(COMMERCIAL BREAK) ', ""MACCALLUM: So, after the bombshell, FBI notes revealed these telling comments as agents prepare to go to the White House to interrogate National Security Adviser General Michael Flynn, telling him that he didn't need a lawyer not to worry about that. They had written on a Bill Priestap, who is head of counterintelligence at the FBI, wrote this on a piece paper. "", ""What is our goal? Truth, admission, or to get him to lie so we can prosecute him and get him fired?

The FBI exists to investigate crimes, not create them. That from Kim Strassel at the Journal. "", 'Here now, Trey Gowdy, Fox News Contributor and former Chairman of the House Oversight Committee. Trey, welcome. Good to have you here. ', 'TREY GOWDY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Thank you. ', 'MACCALLUM: What do you think? Was the notes. Were the notes and was the investigation of General Michael Flynn at the White House routine for the FBI and for the agents who carried it out? ', ""GOWDY: I hope not, Martha. And if it is routine, then why didn't they apply the same standard to Hillary Clinton that they did to Michael Flynn. I mean if you go back, so Flynn's under an investigation in the summer of 2016. A counterintelligence investigation. The FBI found nothing. They didn't find an insufficient amount of evidence. They found no evidence and they're about to close this investigation and then he has the conversation with Kislyak. "", ""So, Comey decides to send bureau agents to the White House. Why? I mean that's that fundamental question. Were you investigating a crime, the Logan Act which never been a prosecution under that Act? Or were you conducting a counterintelligence investigation? "", ""If it's a criminal interview, then why did you treat him so differently than the way you did with Hillary Clinton. "", ""Remember, Martha, she had a medium-sized law firm in the room with her. They gave the question to her lawyers before they interviewed her, and they mostly assuredly told her there's a consequence for lying, none of which they did for Michael Flynn Flynn. "", ""MACCALLUM: So I spoke with K.T. McFarland last night who was his deputy, General Flynn's deputy, and she says, you know, that it is really, beyond Flynn, they were hoping that if they pressed him hard enough, and put him in a tough enough position, and held some of his earlier comments against what he said there, that he would flip on President Trump. That he would give up some goods on the president. Do you agree? "", ""GOWDY: Well, I do for this reason. There's a notation in these documents or at least this week to use that defensive briefing as a pretense, as a rule. So, everyone that's offered a defensive briefing by the FBI, keep that in mind. They may be interviewing you. "", 'Remember, Comey did the same thing with Trump. He gave this defensive briefing on the dossier, but he was really interviewing him. They still thought Donald Trump was colluding with Russia when they went to interview with Michael Flynn. ', ""So, I have every expectation they wanted to flip Flynn on the president. The problem was no one with the campaign was colluding with Russia. It wasn't Flynn, it wasn't Trump. It wasn't Papadopoulos. They were wrong about all four of their crossfire hurricane targets. "", ""MACCALLUM: So how come when we heard from Robert Mueller and the investigation two years, and millions and millions of dollars was finished, and we got the report, where were these notes that we're seeing now? "", ""GOWDY: They were not turned over. They have to be turned over if they're going to trial. There's a little bit of debate about it, but I think most people will tell you Brady does not implicate guilty pleas. "", ""So, when Michael Flynn said, I'm going to plead, they didn't have to turn over the notes. But, Martha, this is not the department of, let's see if we can get away with it. And it's not the department of let's see who we can get fired. "", ""It is the Department of Justice. Sally Yates who is hardly a Republican was infuriated when she found out what Comey had done. So that's the Department of Justice. We don't care if you're an R or D, we don't care whether we like you or we don't. We are going to treat you the same. Mueller's folks did not turn over these documents because they didn't think they had to. "", 'MACCALLUM: Yes. With regard to the Durham investigation, because all of this happens with that as a backdrop now. And the reason that we are seeing these documents, and that they were released is because of a subsequent investigation or review of the Michael Flynn situation that was, you know, spurred on by the Attorney General Bill Barr and the Missouri attorney. ', ""So, what does this tell us about what is coming? Because we're also told that Barr and Durham are in pretty regular discussion about the Durham investigation. "", ""GOWDY: Yes. I think the attorney general and U.S. attorney Durham are both very interested in how this whole sordid affair began. So, the four targets, let's just go with Flynn. All right. You're going to put a general under counterintelligence investigation by the world's premier law enforcement agency, why? "", 'What is the factual predicate where you think you have the power to put him under counterintelligence investigation for being an agent of Russia? What was it? I mean, did he read a Chekhov novel? Did he watch Dr. Zhivago? Why did you put Michael Flynn under counterintelligence investigation? ', ""I think that's what Durham and Barr are getting at. None of these investigations were sufficiently factually predicated, and if that's true, then you're going to see a clamping down on the power that we've given the FBI. And it's about damn (Ph) time. "", ""MACCALLUM: Do you think we'll see prosecutions? "", ""GOWDY: No, ma'am. No, ma'am. I was talking to a federal prosecutor on the way over here. But we have got to not only associate accountability with prosecutions. I don't think it -- I think being a terrible FBI agent and treating people unfairly, it may ought to be a crime but I don't think it is a crime. "", ""The take away is, the next time the FBI says they want to talk, tell them no. Tell them, when you clean up your act, when you quit trying to get people fired and see what you can get away with, we will start treating you like this fascinating(Ph) law enforcement agency. But until then, no, thanks, we're done talking with you. "", 'MACCALLUM: Try Gowdy, always good to see you, sir. Thanks for coming in tonight. ', ""GOWDY: Yes, ma'am. You too. Yes, ma'am.

Where is that for Tara Reade, Leslie? ', 'MARSHALL: Well, first of all, I think that every victim male or female that comes forward, and I know this myself as a victim should be believed.

I do look at the investigation that I make on my own as a victim. If is absolutely right for Ms. Reade to feel, because the media didn't cover it, the president didn't speak out against this, that she's being treated differently. "", ""Look, when Dr. Ford came out, Donald Trump actually mocked her. He's been kind of quiet about this, and so as the media. And I think there are a couple of reasons for that. "", ""One, COVID-19, but I also think that there are some credibility issues with Ms. Reade that eventually some people have with Dr. Ford that we didn't see at the onset. And obviously there are going to be a lot of questions when anybody comes up with the timing of somebody in politics who is running for office, especially for the presidency of the United States.

Wade. So that makes a motive a lot more clear in her story. Does it not? ', ""MARSHALL: No, I don't think it makes the motive a lot more clear. I think quite frankly their motives on both sides. One of the things that I wrote about in my column, as you know, and one of the things that I have a real problem with as a victim, is somebody who, like Ms. Reade who has championed in a sense, their perpetrator.

We want to make sure that every individual, every employer, and every person knows how to keep themselves safe in this situation. We've made it clear what the gating criteria is.

I'm going to do a lightning round, quick questions, quick answers, about some of the activities that people are engaging in around the country.

Let's talk about a different issue because we are seeing a lot of governors open up things like beauty salons and spas where people come into very close contact. You're getting a haircut, you're getting a massage with each other. "", 'Question, if both sides, both parties, are wearing masks, is that safe? ', ""BIRX: It's safer, but we've made it clear that that is not a good phase one activity and I think the president has made that clear when he discussed the case in Georgia.

Big crowds of protesters that went into the Michigan state capitol without masks, massing together in close quarters. I'm not asking you about their First Amendment right to protest, that of course they have. But from a public health standpoint, is that safe? "", ""BIRX: It's devastatingly worrisome to me personally because if they go home and infect their grandmother or their grandfather who has a comorbid condition and they have a serious or a very -- or an unfortunate outcome, they will feel guilty for the rest of our lives. So we need to protect each other at the same time we're voicing our discontent. "", ""WALLACE: Let's talk about remdesivir. The FDA gave emergency approval to use of this drug to help people have the virus. Is it a silver bullet in terms of reducing lethality, keeping people from dying and also in terms of side effects? "", ""BIRX: Well, first, it's only half the data and the Data Safety Monitoring Board, an independent group, thought that the improvement was compelling enough and significantly enough to actually say that they couldn't continue the trial as it was, and the placebo arm had to receive the effective drug. So, it's a first step forward. "", 'In parallel, we have a whole series of therapeutics including plasma and also monoclonal antibodies being worked through.

"", ""WALLACE: Then, there's Operation Warp Speed, which is the Trump administration's effort to try to develop a vaccine by next January. Now, you and Dr. Fauci have talked sort of the rule of thumb is 12 months to 18 months, that would be considerably shorter than that timetable. Next January, is that realistic? "", ""BIRX: The way that it's possible is if you bring forward five or six different classes of candidates, which the Operation Warp Speed has done. And so it's not relying on a single vaccine platform. It's relying on several different candidates that are made differently and act differently.

It's whether we can execute and execute around the globe, because you also, for phase three, have to have active viral transmission in the community in order to study its efficacy.

"", ""REEVES: Well, that's a great question, Chris, and it's a fair question. And what I would tell you is that you have to understand that Mississippi is different than New York and Mississippi is different than New Jersey.

And recent polls show that -- that when people are asked to choose, they're more concerned about safety, even if it means staying sheltered for a while longer, than in reopening.

They couldn't be there to hold their loved ones hands when they died. So there is grief on that end. "", ""But, at the same time, there is no doubt the economy and the economic impacts of this are devastating. When you have car lines up to six miles in San Antonio for people to get food -- these are people who were working through no fault of their own. They find themselves in this position.

And what do you make of the president's talk that he would at least consider bringing Michael Flynn, whom he fired, because he had allegedly lied to the vice president, bringing him back into the White House? "", ""PERINO: Well, I think the -- I think that we might be over reading the president's answer on that a little bit. He never likes to close off possibilities for him in the future. So I don't think that he was saying, I'm definitely going to bring Michael Flynn back, but he has maintained, from the beginning, that this is a good man, a war hero, somebody who was treated unfairly by the Justice Department.

Will the Justice Department try to re-prosecute? ', ""And I also think that there are still some questions about, how did this all happen in the first place? And, you know, there's political appointees at the Justice Department and the FBI from the previous administration who have been very quiet. And I think in this investigation, they're probably going to have to come out and explain a little bit more if they want to help all of us understand what in the world was going on back then. "", 'WALLACE: Marie, what do you think of the -- of the FBI documents that were released this week and the claim by some people that they exonerate General Flynn and, as you just heard Kayleigh McEnany say, that this was a miscarriage of justice? ', ""HARF: Well, they certainly don't exonerate Michael Flynn and I think the documents show an FBI that was trying to figure out the best way to handle a very politically sensitive investigation with Michael Flynn. And the bottom line is that Michael Flynn lied, not just to the vice president, but to the FBI. He is a highly trained military intelligence officer, Chris. He is not someone who's taken for a ride or a rube. He is not stupid. He -- he decided, when he had the choice, when he was required to tell the truth under oath, he decided to lie. He pled guilty to it. And so whatever internal deliberations the FBI was having, that still remains the fact. "", ""WALLACE: Do -- do -- are you troubled at all by these documents that we're seeing now in which people are discussing, you know, we're going to interview Flynn and, you know, should we try to catch him in a lie? Also, should we get him fired, which seems like an odd thing for a law enforcement agency to do? Is there nothing in those documents that troubles you, Marie? "", ""HARF: There's nothing in these documents that shows me that this is a politically motivated investigation. And they're asking questions about how to handle that. That happens all the time in FBI investigations. "", ""But Michael Flynn is the one who chose to lie about his contact with foreign governments, including the Russians. So, of course, I want more information about this, Chris. But nothing I've seen tells me that this wasn't a good investigation. "", ""WALLACE: Guy, your thoughts about -- about the overall investigation of Michael Flynn and what we learned or didn't learn this week about it? "", 'BENSON: I think a big question is why that interview took place at all. And if you read Kimberley Strassel\'s column in ""The Wall Street Journal,"" it is pretty devastating. I think it\'s totally possible to say he was railroaded and there was misconduct at the FBI. But also, to Marie\'s point, he didn\'t choose to lie to the vice president. He did have some very shady dealings, for example, with the government of Turkey. Maybe he shouldn\'t have been in that position in the first place, right? So you can maybe say, perhaps he wasn\'t the best pick for a national security advisor. That doesn\'t mean there wasn\'t abuse. And I think some of the documents we saw this week point to abuse. ', ""WALLACE: It -- well, we've got about 30 seconds. What -- what are you most troubled by? Where do you see possible abuse? "", ""BENSON: Well, I think mostly it's the pretenses under which that interview was set up in the first place, right, where they were basically saying -- and Comey, the former FBI director admitted this, he sent the agents there, using sort of a chaotic, new White House to sort of get this -- this FBI investigation to come to the White House doorstep and it just -- the notes in the -- in the actual documents about saying -- trying to get him to lie, try to get him fired, it doesn't smell great.

But how could so many people be tested so quickly?', 'In addition to recruiting thousands of health care workers and supporting staff and pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into the campaign, the city has promoted the drive via fliers, social media posts and loudspeaker announcements; Wuhan also ramped up its diagnostic testing capacity by pooling samples from different people together and processing them in small batches, according to the Times.', 'U.S. cities could adopt a similar ""pooled testing"" strategy to screen many residents at once and keep abreast of new waves of infection — but the approach only works as long as the overall prevalence of COVID-19 remains low, experts told Live Science.', 'Related:\xa0Coronavirus testing is ramping up. Here are the new tests and how they work.', '""If you\'re surveilling a low prevalence population, it\'s a very effective way of finding outbreaks,"" said Dr. James Zehnder, director of Clinical Pathology at Stanford University School of Medicine. ""I hope that the FDA [U.S. Food and Drug Administration] is supportive of implementing this widely.""', ""After about a month with no newly confirmed cases of COVID-19, Wuhan reported six new cases during the week of May 14,\xa0The New York Times reported. Soon after, the city government announced its plans for a swift and widespread diagnostic testing drive, aimed at snuffing out a potential second wave of infection. While some experts questioned the need to test the majority of Wuhan's 11 million residents, when a smaller sample might suffice, the extensive testing drive still demonstrates the utility of pooled testing, according to the Times."", 'Namely, the technique allows many diagnostic tests to be processed in a short window of time, and with minimal testing materials, experts told Live Science.', 'When an outbreak starts, it spreads quickly"" — too quickly to catch if you\'re only screening people with overt\xa0symptoms of COVID-19, said Peter Frazier, an associate professor and data scientist at Cornell University, whose lab is modeling how best to implement pooled testing in the U.S. Given that asymptomatic people may spread the virus\xa0through breathing and talking, by the time symptomatic people begin seeking diagnostic tests, the outbreak may be well underway.', 'Related:\xa011 (sometimes) deadly diseases that hopped across species', 'But with pooled testing, a given population can be screened for COVID-19 periodically; that way, \xa0so-called silent spreaders\xa0can be identified and isolated, and their recent contacts can be alerted of potential infection, Frazier said.', '""It\'s hard to have a scenario where you\'re testing every single person in a population,"" but the strategy could be particularly useful for screening high-risk groups, Zehnder said. Schools, nursing homes and correctional facilities, as well as populations of health care workers and first responders, could implement a schedule of pooled testing to spot outbreaks before they run out of control, he said.', 'For pooled testing in Wuhan, health care workers take swab samples from the noses and throats of several people and deposit the samples in a single plastic tube, the Times reported. The batch of samples can then be scanned for evidence of viral genetic material using a method called polymerase chain reaction (PCR).', ""If the whole test tube tests negative, all the swabs within can be considered negative for the virus; if the tube tests positive, swabs included in the pooled can be retested individually to determine which specific sample contains viral particles. A portion of each swab sample usually gets reserved for the purpose of retesting, so people don't have to return to the test site to be swabbed a second time, Zehnder said."", 'To ensure that the results of the pooled\xa0tests are as accurate as possible, labs must carefully consider how many samples to include in each batch, said Chris Bilder, a statistics professor at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln whose lab studies the use of group testing for infectious diseases, including sexually transmitted diseases.', 'The ideal ""pool size"" — number of swabs in each pooled sample — largely depends on the prevalence of disease in a given population, Bilder said. If a high proportion of the population has COVID-19, many pooled tests would come back positive and require further processing. At a certain point, pooled testing ceases to be efficient and the lab must revert to standard, individual testing, he said.', 'For example, in March, the Nebraska Public Health Laboratory received approval from the FDA to use pooled testing for COVID-19, as long as the positive test rate remained below 10% and pooled samples included no more than five swabs each,\xa0Scientific American reported. Bilder and Brianna Hitt, a recently graduated doctoral student in his lab,\xa0developed an easy-to-use app\xa0that helped the lab determine what pool sizes would work best given those parameters.', 'Originally designed with STD screening in mind, the app can be repurposed toward COVID-19 diagnostic testing, Bilder said. The app takes disease prevalence and test accuracy into account to determine what range of pool sizes would be suitable. In addition, users can compare different methods of pooling to see which works best for their particular sample, he said.', '""The lower the prevalence, the higher the pool size that you can use,"" he said.', ""Say you're testing 100 people and disease prevalence is 5%; with standard testing, you'd use 100 tests to test everyone and spot an average of five active infections. With pooled testing, you can lump swabs into groups of five and only use 20 tests in the process. Even if five groups came back positive and required retesting, you would only use 45 tests total as compared to 100."", 'In addition to disease prevalence, labs must consider a phenomenon called ""the dilution effect"" when determining pool sizes, Frazier said. PCR machines can process only so much fluid at one time; the larger the pool size grows, the smaller the proportion of fluid contributed by each swab becomes, he said. As a positive swab will contain a finite number of viral particles, enlarging the pool size can lower your chances of spotting those few particles in a batch sample, he said.', 'This dilution effect ""sets the ceiling"" for your pool size, and ""below that ceiling, the right pool size is based on [disease] prevalence.""', 'To double-check for false results, pooled tests that come back negative can be redistributed in slightly larger pools and run through PCR once more, a process known as ""back-screening,"" Bilder said. Another method to ensure accuracy,\xa0currently being verified by Frazier\xa0and his collaborators at Cornell University, pools samples in a grid of columns and rows of test tubes. If both a column and row among the samples tests positive, the tube at their intersection should contain a positive swab test common to both.', 'Pooled testing first surfaced during World War II, when military personnel received widespread testing for syphilis,\xa0Scientific American reported. Since then, the approach has been used to screen for a variety of diseases, including\xa0HIV, chlamydia and\xa0malaria.', 'Related:\xa028 devastating infectious diseases', '""This isn\'t new,"" Bilder said. Well-established methods of pooled testing now just need to be repurposed for COVID-19 testing, he said.', 'Before pooled testing can be implemented widely, each proposed protocol must first gain approval from the FDA, Frazier added. Despite this potential regulatory hurdle, the fact that the Nebraska Public Health Laboratory gained conditional approval suggests a precedent for future pooled testing, he said.', 'Beyond developing the protocols and earning FDA approval, labs wishing to conduct pooled testing must assess ""who should be tested and how often,"" Zehnder said. Again, high-risk groups might be prioritized for more frequent testing, while representative samples from the broader population could be collected less frequently in comparison, he said. Whether effective containment of the virus requires testing populations every three days, once a week or twice a month, will likely vary by location and relative need, he said.', 'And although pooled sampling does help conserve testing supplies, a robust infrastructure must be in place to organize the gathering of samples and distribution of results, Zehnder added. ""The simplest way is if people can swab themselves and then mail it in,"" thus avoiding a potentially risky trip to a physical testing site, he said. Once the samples can be gathered and processed, there must be a way to use that information to guide a public health response, which would include tracing potential infections and isolating positive cases in the community, he said.', 'Pooled testing, alone, cannot snuff out outbreaks; the measure must be coupled with compliance from community members and effective public health measures, like widespread contact tracing, Zehnder said.', '""This is the conversation people need to be having as the economy begins to open up,"" he said.', 'Originally published on\xa0Live Science.\xa0']"

It is good news that the virus is not nearly as deadly as we thought it was when we first saw this, or that hospitals are not overrun like that we thought they were. ', 'But I was interested in an article that was in ""Politico"" today about how Democrats say that their nightmare scenario is that the economy might get back up and running before the November election. And I do think there is a political concern here that people don\'t want to reopen in part because they are worried that a strong economy is one of Donald Trump\'s best arguments for his reelection and that they don\'t -- and they think that hurting the economy might help Democratic prospects. And so it\'s important people care about public health and not keep the economy locked down for political reasons. ', 'BAIER: To that end, it seems like this is going to be, Amy, big part of this election. And the Biden camp out with an ad. Take a listen. ', '(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ', ""JOE BIDEN, (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We should stop rewarding wealth and start rewarding work a little bit. Let's raise the capital gains tax for people making over $1 million a year to ordinary income. Let's reverse the Trump tax cut. Nobody making under $400,000 should have their taxes raised, period.

', 'AMY WALTER, NATIONAL EDITOR, ""COOK POLITICAL REPORT"": So the economy has been the centerpiece question from the very beginning, long before this pandemic. The question was, why is an economy that\'s doing so well not benefiting the president politically? We saw at one point he had approval ratings on the economy close to 60 percent. And yet when you looked at it the overall approval ratings, they were still mired in the 40s, and matched up against Joe Biden he was still losing. ', ""So the challenge for the president has long been that the economy in and of itself isn't really the issue in this election. A lot of what this election is going to hinge on, that we are in the middle of a crisis, so let's just put into perspective. We may be in another health crisis by the time October or November comes around, we may not be. We will certainly be in an economic crisis regardless. Even if the economy does come back pretty well, there are going to be a lot of people still hurting economically. "", ""But the real question in my mind has long been, how are voters squaring their perception of the president and how he serves as president, the behavior, the way he conducts himself, versus what he's doing on the economy per se? It is true, most residents who are running in a bad economy tend not to get reelected. But this is not a typical type of recession, and this president has not seen, unlike other presidents, a big bump when things are good. "", 'BAIER: Right. But why, then, Guy, are Democrats, including the former vice president, openly worrying about the V-shaped recovery that may come as the bounce back here in the third quarter? ""Politico"" had a big piece today. Joe Biden was asked about that in a CNN interview in which he said yes, these people coming back to work and the economy churning is going to look a lot steeper in the recovery right around the election.

"", ""Look, I think that a lot of this comes down to the question, to Amy's point, will President Trump have a narrative that is sellable heading into November? And I don't think we are really going to know that until September or October. It's going to depend on the facts and the realities on the ground for actual voters, slogans. They can talk about pivoting to greatness or the great American comeback. If those don't feel real, if they sound like empty words to people, then the president can say them until he's blue in the face, it's not going to matter. "", ""But if it lines up with the reality that people are living every day, and they're like, OK, maybe we have gotten through the public health crisis. Maybe it wasn't handled perfectly but we are recovering now, and perhaps we are starting to recover also on the economic front and I am starting to feel that, then those slogans, those catchphrases would resonate. And I'm not sure what the response of that will be from Democrats without sounding like they are trying to talk down a comeback from a very dark place, which, as I said, is not a great look. "", ""BAIER: The hope, Mollie, is that this is not political and the decisions being made are based on numbers and what governors are seeing on the ground. But it is seeming, more and more, like it is a stay-at-home-order versus an open-the-government battle. Even the site of the Republican National Convention, the president threatening that Charlotte, if North Carolina, the governor can't give them an answer, maybe he will move it, and Georgia is already pitching, saying bring it to Georgia. "", ""HEMINGWAY: Right. You are definitely seeing a partisan divide in how governors are handling like this, even if it's not a perfect partisan divide. And you're also seeing that reflected in polls about what individuals themselves want in terms of reopening the economy or keeping it shut down. There are so many questions going into the summer about sporting events, conventions, and whatnot. "", ""But we are in a much better place now than we were a few months ago. I do think it's important that the media be much better about accurately describing who is really at risk from this. They seem to overhype the general risk of what's happening to the population while under-hyping something day-in and day-out, which is that nursing homes have absolutely been ravaged by the coronavirus. Half of all deaths are in nursing homes, maybe even more. That's not just in the United States but worldwide. And so the more that we do general things that don't matter, like shutting down the outdoor spaces but not taking care of nursing homes, is not good for us.

358,New Navy satellite technology could improve ocean weapons attack,2020-05-20,https://www.foxnews.com/tech/new-navy-satellite-technology-could-improve-ocean-weapons-attack,"[""Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com."", 'The Pentagon’s Defense Innovation Unit (DIU) has made a new deal to develop single-antenna satellite connectivity to operate multiple beams simultaneously and maximize networking among U.S. Navy surface ships.', 'DIU will, according to a deal with Isotropic, begin prototyping the antenna technology, engineered to support “multiple links over multiple bands of satellite capacity,” including S, C, Ka, Ku, X and Q-band connections. The DIU evaluation will also seek to recreate challenging wartime contingencies such as an ability to operate in rough seas, sustain high winds and function in areas where there may be electromagnetic interference.', 'Should this new multi-beam forming technology come to fruition, it will bring with it a number of interesting tactical implications; increased bandwidth through multi-satellite connectivity could also enhance functionality of some weapons systems. For instance, the Navy’s ship-launched Maritime Tomahawk can use high-throughput radio signals to help direct a missile toward a moving target at sea. This, of course, brings new attack options for Navy ships which have historically only used Tomahawks against fixed-targets. Improved bandwidth and precise, multi-beam forming connectivity between multiple satellites at once could improve targeting and weapons guidance by, perhaps in some scenarios, handing-off a targeting track quickly from one satellite to another as an incoming threat travels from one region to another; sharing sensor data from one satellite sensing envelope to another in real-time can help share targeting information, track long-range attacks and connect otherwise disparate units to one another. Networking multiple satellites and ship-or-ground-based terminals could bring new advantages for dismounted soldiers as well, many of whom rely upon radio networks across and between swaths of rugged terrain. Other air, ground and ship-fired weapons, such as Hellfire missiles, can draw from RF for targeting guidance.', 'NAVY ARMS SEA DRONES FOR OCEAN ATTACK', 'The U.S. military, which is now aggressively preparing for space war, is quickly building and flying new satellites. Some of these include emerging networks of Very Low Earth Orbit (vLEO) satellites, smaller, lower-flying nodes intended to connect to the ground and one another while moving quickly and operating closer to the boundaries of the earth’s atmosphere. This phenomenon, coupled with concurrent Pentagon efforts to build more larger satellites, is intended to not only improve multi-node networking but also facilitate several key elements of the Air Force’s space war strategy -- redundancy, disaggregation and resiliency. The more satellites there are in space ... and the more dispersed or dis-aggregated they are ... the harder it is for an enemy to knock out U.S. operational connectivity. Combat crucial satellite transmissions, including radio, data, video and other networking mediums and guidance systems, can sustain functionality in the event that one is jammed or destroyed by an Anti-Satellite (ASAT) weapon. Therefore, faster, multi-satellite, beam-forming antenna technology ensuring connectivity across multiple nodes in space, can preserve operational necessities such as air-ground connectivity, ship-to-ship radio transmissions and cross-domain networking. While this technology could at the moment be described as nascent or emerging … yet believed to be resilient and highly mature … it could eventually evolve toward having additional space war, weapons guidance, jamming and even missile defense applications.', '\n      The USS Kidd flies its traditional skull and crossbones flag while passing downtown San Diego as it returns to Naval Base San Diego, Tuesday, April 28, 2020, as seen from Coronado, Calif. - file photo.\n      (AP Photo/Gregory Bull)', 'CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP', '“Over the course of the next 10 years, the amount of available options in space for connectivity will be vast, with anywhere between thousands of satellites, to tens of thousands of satellites, operating in different frequencies and different orbits,” Isotropic CEO John Finney said in a Via Satellite essay. “You then have two choices.

And we saw the roundtable yesterday with law enforcement leaders, including the National Police Union to try to come up with some ideas that everybody can be comfortable with that still allow police to be on the streets. And the numbers that the president believes they need to be in. "", ""But at the same time, make sure that the community is protected from potential bad apples in the police department and that there's a greater engagement between police forces and the community. The president said yesterday that one of the things that really has to happen here is police departments need to rebuild trust or build trust if they don't have it now with the communities that they serve to make sure that people can live together to a greater degree of harmony than they clearly are now. "", ""As you see, the people lining the streets there in Houston as the hearse makes its way to the burial plot where George Floyd will be buried beside his mother. So a lot happening here in Washington. Dana, we don't know how quickly it's going to happen. There has been some suggestion that maybe we will get the ideas later on this week. It may not be until next week. We'll see. "", 'PERINO: John, thank you so much. Let me now bring in Jesse Watters, Juan Williams, Brian Kilmeade, and Dagen McDowell, as we continue to see there on your screen the funeral procession of George Floyd as he goes to his final resting place. It will be next to his mother, the woman he cried out for in his final moments. ', 'Juan Williams, if I could start with you, reflections on today or on what we just heard about news from Washington about some possible bipartisan agreement about some potential police reforms. ', ""JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Thanks, Dana. So I think it's been a very emotional day for the family. And it was really the family that spoke about George Floyd at the funeral in such personal ways, to talk about a poor kid who grew up in the projects in the third ward in Houston. The kid, who, you know, was so big, known as Big George or Perry. "", ""And, you know, started Jack Yates High School in Houston. That's a very human picture far away from all the news and noise and all the protests. What we see is a human being. And I think it was -- it's so appropriate that we focus on the fact that there's a man there who lost his life in an unfortunate manner. In response to your question about all that's going on, I think, you know, there's so much arguing sometimes about this slogan, de- fund the police. "", ""And I think you see, as John Roberts just reported, that this idea of reforming the police has tremendous power and is very popular, even extending to the White House now in terms of what steps can be taken in order to make the policing more effective and prevent acts of brutality. So I think that we are in a moment where we can start to see that maybe this is something that's much larger that, you know, as they said at the funeral. "", 'George Floyd was known to almost no one outside the family and friends before now. But he has started a movement and his name will be remembered. ', 'PERINO: Dagen McDowell, maybe talk a little bit about that family. And of course, they shared their grief with all of us today. And I know that you are no stranger to grief. I mean, people are -- life is hard and we lose loved ones. This one playing out on the world stage and the family coming to the podium today to really talk about him and how they loved on him and be willing to cry in front of all of us. ', ""DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: When you lose a family member in such a violent way, it's like any other -- it's unlike any loss anyone could experience. But funerals are about healing. It's not just to remember the life of the person who passed. It is about showing up and starting the healing process, particularly for the family. You show up. You go. You pray for them. "", ""You offer your unwavering support, this day and in the days and weeks and months to come. But this is not just about beginning the journey of healing for George Floyd's family. It is also about healing for our nation and really around the world. I am sure millions of people watched this funeral today, and it is about remembering. There's a higher power guiding us and saving us. "", ""And hopefully, remembering this day and watching that funeral. I watched every minute of it. We are a different nation tomorrow and next week and next month. And we will do what's right in George Floyd's name. We will do what is right for one another. "", ""PERINO: Jesse Watters, let's get some of your thoughts today. "", ""JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Well, it's a good reminder that the last two weeks have really been about George Floyd. As Juan said, it's not about cliches or empty slogans. It's about justice for Floyd and what can we do for that. How do we end racism? It really has to do with people's hearts, not what they chant or how they light something on fire and how we attack each other on television. "", ""It's really about your heart. And what do people want in this country? They want to be treated fairly and equally under the law, no matter what their skin color, no matter what car they drive, what they look like, where they have been born, what political party that they're from, what religion they are. But they just want to be treated equally. And if we can start there, that's a very good start. "", ""The other thing is people want respect. The police want respect. They don't want to be cursed at. They don't want to be hit. They don't want people running away. They don't want people resisting. But the subjects themselves who are being pulled over, they really want respect, too. And when you come in and you're a police officer into a high crime area, whether it's white or black. "", ""A lot of the times when you pull people out of the car, you detain them in handcuffs. You don't make an arrest. You just detain them in handcuffs. Maybe you even make them lay down on the ground. They do that with white people. They do that with black people. Police officers do that to protect themselves because they don't know what's in the car, if someone has a weapon, who this person is. "", ""They do that for their own safety, for everybody's safety. But it's easy to see how, if you're at an African-American person in this country, and if you live in a high crime area and you are innocent and you haven't done anything wrong and you are constantly being pulled over and told to get in the handcuffs. You're just being detained. And lay down on your stomach. "", ""After a while, that's going to build up. So the police officers, they need to use some sort of de-escalation tactics without putting themselves in danger because they are scared, too. These are really tough areas sometimes. And they are in these tough areas because they love these areas. They want to help people. They don't want to hurt people. "", ""The police officers in this country have saved so many more black lives than they have taken. And I think it's just important to what we talked about yesterday, this idea of community policing, getting to know people, getting to know the community, and trusting and rebuilding that trust. And that could go a long way before we get the idea of, you know, bigger internal affairs departments. "", 'Or better use of tasers or mandatory body cameras, things like that -- that can happen later. But I think first we just need to respect one another and treat each other equally. ', ""PERINO: Beautifully said. Brian Kilmeade, obviously, you're a person that's written about history in America, has dealt with this issue of racism over and over again. And a lot of people at the funeral today said they do believe that there will be change after the murder of George Floyd. Tell me a little bit about your thoughts and reflections on that today. "", ""BRIAN KILMEADE, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: I have a lot a lot. And I'm just going to try to stay focused. Number one, this is the conversation I thought we were going to have two weeks ago. But the protests became riots and the violence became overwhelming. And the police became the story. And law and order became the issue because they just overwhelmed, which was the loss of a life that I think 96 percent of the country thought was egregious, horrific. "", ""And there needs to be justice for that police officer who's now sitting in prison probably for the rest of his life, and a million-dollar bail. And the three others, we can litigate it. Let's see what happens. But this should've been the focus. And as I watched Al Sharpton speak, he's talking about slavery 250 years ago. And he's named after a slave master. "", ""And he goes to one grave and they're not even his family. He's not even buried there. Those are white people that -- the black people will bury at a different direction. And you talk about history, the project I'm working on over the next two years. Looking at Frederick Douglass, Booker T. Washington, and I'll tell you. "", ""When you -- as much as prideful as I am of America, I am so horrified about the firsthand accounts of what it was like being black in America and a slave in America. It's everything as bad as you've been reading and seeing in the movies. When you get the account from people who lived in the 1800s, the people who were slaves like Frederick Douglass, escaped to and then fought hard with Lincoln to do the best we can to make our country better. "", ""You see how far we've come. But you see the scars are still there. And we are going to go back to wondering for people that aren't racist, like everyone that I met at Fox and everyone on this panel right now. I want to know what we can do to get past this. Because every time something goes wrong, we want to blame the cops or we want to blame whoever is in the middle of this. "", ""I am wondering, as a country, how do we move past it and let people know who are watching, no matter your color, no matter your ethnic background, that we agree with you, that we think you're all equal. We will do our best to let you know that we feel that way. And there is a minority of people who feel as though they are better than you because of the color of their skin and their ethnic or religious background. But that's not the majority in this country. "", ""PERINO: Brian Kilmeade, thank you, everybody, thank you. We have a lot more to come. You're watching the funeral procession of George Floyd. It will continue, and we will be right back on THE FIVE. "", '(COMMERCIAL BREAK) ', ""WATTERS: Welcome back. You are looking live at the funeral procession of George Floyd in Houston, Texas, a very emotional day for his family and his friends, Floyd's death igniting a nationwide debate over police reform. President Trump set to unveil a series of proposals as soon as this week. While many of the Democratic Party pushed back against calls to de-fund the police, the movement facing blowback across the political spectrum. "", 'Top Democrats trying to distance themselves from it, including presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden. ', '(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ', ""JOE BIDEN (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I don't support de-funding the police. I support conditioning federal aid to police based on whether or not they meet certain basic standards of decency and honorableness, and in fact, are able to demonstrate they can protect the community and everybody in the community. "", '(END VIDEO CLIP) ', 'WATTERS: But some leaders like the Minneapolis City Council president continue to call for dismantling the police. ', '(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ', 'UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I think the idea of having a police-free future is very aspirational. The commitment (ph) is clearly a long-term commitment. Our police department has been in place for 150 years. We cannot take 150 years to solve this problem. But we absolutely will need to build up those systems of public safety as the highest priority, as the very first priority, along with getting more accountability in our police department today. ', 'WATTERS: All right. Dana, what kind of political position does this put Democrats in, who were, you know, I think nationally trying to distance themselves from the de-fund the police movement. But you have a very, very vocal minority of people on the fringes that are screaming pretty loudly about this and are not backing down. ', ""PERINO: It's very interesting. So Speaker Pelosi, when she was asked about it yesterday when they introduced the Democrats ideas for reform on policing. She was asked about it. And she said, well, that's a local matter. But that's -- it's -- that's -- it's not just a local matter. I mean, they basically -- they painted it on the street of Washington, D.C. "", ""And they are having to answer these questions for a reason. They obviously would prefer that they didn't have to deal with the fringe coming up with this idea to de-fund the police. But you're actually having conversations now. I heard a couple of podcasts today where I -- because I wanted to understand. What do they -- do they really mean that there would be no police? And this idea for example, that you would have a social worker respond without any protection to a domestic violence call. "", ""I can see that you wouldn't want to escalate things, but what if the domestic violence call is in fact violent and you have to protect the police officer or the person that is being victimized? I mean, a lot of this -- it doesn't make sense. You pull on the thread and it's not there. I do think that there will be some progressives who will get frustrated with the Democratic establishment and the prospective nominee, Joe Biden, for not taking them seriously. "", ""They are going to try to water down, as we said yesterday that they don't really mean to de-fund the police. Like, some of them actually do. But I think in the long run, the police departments are not going to be de- funded. They might be reformed. But I think cooler heads will prevail in the end. "", ""WATTERS: Yeah. I would agree with that. Kilmeade, do you think that Joe Biden risks being pulled really far to the left, because he really does have to cater to this de-fund the police movement. And he's having some having some trouble kind of articulating exactly what that means. Could he get bogged down in something like this? "", ""KILMEADE: Jesse, there's no question about it, or should I say Watters. There's no question about it, because we see people going way to the left. And everybody else is not going to way to the left, tried to bow out of it artfully like Nancy Pelosi. But the one thing Joe Biden has, and even the Washington Post pointed out today, is he has got a past. "", ""And in this past, he's tough on crime. And he's not really worried about people's economic circumstances or the situation with the color of people's skin. He came out with that crime bill. He was behind it. He campaigned on it. He was proud of it. And he was running on it until he got the nomination now. And he suddenly says to himself I hope nobody has Google to see where I stood on this for the last 40 years until recently. "", ""So I think he's got a huge issue. The other problem I have is Minneapolis, New York, and Los Angeles, have already made moves to de-fund the police. So you're not happy with their performance. So let them perform with less, less people, less equipment, less financing, worse uniforms, maybe worse guns. So let's take a look at these cities. "", 'New York City, shootings have increased 18 percent, burglaries 31 percent, carjacking 64 percent, good to know carjackings back, Minneapolis, carjackings up 45 percent, homicides up 60 percent, burglaries up 28 percent. And we know what goes on in Los Angeles where the police union came out and said are you kidding me? We got 10,000 policemen here. ', ""We are overwhelmed. And now, you're cutting our budget and calling us killers. So thanks a lot. There is a reality and there's rhetoric. The reality is there's not going to be a person in this country who is going to want to be a cop after a while. There's not a lot of glory in it these days. "", ""WATTERS: That's right. And as you can see there, the funeral procession is exiting off of the highway. And we're going to stay close on that and keep you posted on what happens as George Floyd is going to be laid to rest in a little while. Juan Williams, just picking up on what Kilmeade just mentioned. Does bother you at all that some of these things came out of this legitimate movement that are so silly? "", 'You know, I looked at some of the fine print with the de-fund the police. They are talking about decriminalizing prostitution, you know, sending a therapist to a crime scene, really, really ridiculous things. Does that take away from this movement, in your opinion, when you add that to all the looting and the violence that took place? ', ""WILLIAMS: I think that's a distortion of this moment. I mean, you know, to my mind, if we are on THE FIVE were discussing left-wing Democratic politics, I think we would say Bernie Sanders could personify that. And what did Bernie Sanders say today? He is not at all engaged with de-fund the police. He thinks that's not a good idea. He said a non-starter. "", ""And what Bernie Sanders is saying is we have to find more effective ways of defining what we mean by policing. That is Bernie Sanders' far left Democratic politics. You are hearing much the same from Joe Biden, from Nancy Pelosi, from the mayor of Minneapolis. You know, everybody is saying we have to respond to the George Floyd situation. But it's not about saying, oh, there's not going to be any police. "", 'Instead, people are thinking about, well, how do you do this more effectively, because if someone has a mental health issue, sending someone with a gun might not be the best way to deal with it. It maybe the case that that person becomes violence, at which point you do want to send a police officer, but again, is it the case that we want to strengthen something like mental health services or for drug addicts, they want to strengthen drug treatment programs. ', ""This is a kind of more sophisticated way and not putting police on what is really -- should not be police work in the country. So I think that there's -- it's important to understand that even as you can, you know, sort of caricature de-fund the police and make it an argument. It's a distortion from the reality of the kind of conversation. "", ""Even the kind of legislation that we are seeing on Capitol Hill where they are talking about no chokeholds, not allowing people -- not allowing the police just to no knock just rush in your house. And in the case of Breonna Taylor, kill her. Or, you know, increase data on use of excessive force by police so we that can properly, as a society, track what's going on and not allow the police to be belittled or charged with things that are not fair. "", ""This is all part of making us better. And I don't think that it's fair to just say it's all about some loons on the left. As I said, even the people we would identify as the far left are not embracing this. "", ""WATTERS: Yeah. And that's what I'm trying to reconcile, because, you know, this is the fine print from the Black Lives Matter movement. This is what the city council from Minneapolis is saying they want. This was ground zero. So I'm not distorting it. I think we're just reporting what's kind of bubbled up from this movement. And what has bubbled up, as you say correctly, is very, very fringe. "", ""Dagen, you know, we talk a lot about Joe Biden. And we talked a lot about Bernie Sanders and Nancy Pelosi. The president obviously has to release some reforms pretty soon within the next couple days. How do you think he's handled the last week or so? "", 'MCDOWELL: At some point, the American people need to hear from President Trump in a carefully-worded message of -- to use a word I used when we started the show, of healing here. But also, what are you going to do in terms of police reforms? Juan mentioned mental health. Congressman Will Hurd wrote an editorial a few days ago in The Wall Street Journal and pointed out that 10 percent of police calls and more than one quarter of fatal police shootings involved person with a mental illness. ', ""Yet, most states only require officers to undergo less than eight hours of training in handling these situations. But very often, when money is funnelled into mental health services like here in New York City with ThriveNYC, which is run by the mayor's wife, she and the mayor spent $1 billion on that mental health initiative and couldn't even account for the number of people it helped or even how they helped them. So again, that's what happens when people start talking about we're going to take money from police departments and move it into social services. "", 'New York already tried that experiment. And the murder rate 30 years ago was more than six times higher than it is right now. It was only the addition of 6,000 police officers by Mayor David Dinkins at the time, and then the introduction of rigorous policing and responsibility and accountability through CompStat. ', ""But locally, what is very dangerous and it's happening in New York that's going on is the dangerous fallacy that crimes are victimless. That's the message that was sent by the bail reform here in New York. If you go down the list of crimes where people are arrested and don't have to put up any bail, it's changed slightly, they've tried to tweak it. "", ""But if you go down the list of crimes, try aggravated assault of a child under the age of 11. You don't have to put up bail. And then you also have in San Francisco, the new D.A. there eliminating cash bail and stop prosecuting what they call victimless crimes. Guess what, every crime has a victim. "", ""If you get punched in the face in New York City and sent to the emergency room, there's no bail for that perp. There's no bail for that criminal. If a store gets robbed. There's no bail for that criminal. That's got to change and that's where the danger lies. It is in how local authorities the most progressive of the left are handling crime in this nation. "", ""WATTERS: Yes, I would agree with that. We're monitoring the funeral procession of George Floyd. Stay with THE FIVE. "", '(COMMERCIAL BREAK) ', ""KILMEADE: All right, you're looking live at the funeral procession of George Floyd in Houston, Texas. It was a long moving processional today. President Trump preparing though as well to unveil a series of police reforms in the wake of Floyd's death. The whole world watched. All the networks carried, especially us. "", ""The President working with both Congress and the DOJ to come up with a set of proposals that will prioritize protection for communities without tying the hands of police.

How do you respond to that? ', ""SEN. KAMALA HARRIS (D-CA): Well, it's just it's creating fear where none is necessary. We have to stop militarization of police. But that doesn't mean we get rid of the police. Of course not. "", '(END VIDEO CLIP) ', ""KILMEADE: And that was Kamala Harris earlier. And that's what's going to be happening after we'll be debating this. But right now, we're seeing the casket of George Floyd being taken from the hearse into the horse-drawn carriage, to the final resting place, which will be right by his mom. "", ""This where he grew up. He went to Minneapolis. He actually went to college -- sports scholarship. After two years, came back and has settled over in Minneapolis where this whole incident had taken place. A fine athlete in his day. And now people were talking about his life all day and what his life meant, what it's meant to his family. "", ""Now, I'll tell you, under any circumstances, as we see the casket being pushed in, this is extraordinary circumstance. Under any circumstance, to go through the funeral of a loved one is trying. And it is a great tribute to that person's life when you have a long funeral, when you have a long procession, and when you have multiple memorial services, but is also emotionally taxing. "", ""I mean, how many times you got to recount, how many times you get to recalibrate, how many times you get to look back at George's life, what he meant to you, what he meant to others, and also in the bigger picture, now what he's meant to the country. I mean, you have people from other countries in front of U.S. embassies and in front of their own cities demanding reforms in their own countries, citing what's happened in this country because of the way George lost his life. "", ""And we're also as I just mentioned before, as a just segue to, we were -- we're talking about law enforcement, the changes that could be made, the things that we could learn from. And in extreme circumstances, you have a movement in Minneapolis, and movement in New York City, and movement in Los Angeles. "", ""As one mentioned earlier, maybe it's fringe but it's actually happening in three major cities to cut back on police funding and put it into different programs. As you see, a final salute to George Floyd himself. And as he's going to be brought to his final resting place. "", ""So Dana, as we -- as we look at this happening taking place, the whole world is watching. The whole world's watching. This is not just an American story anymore. "", 'PERINO: So, you know, through history that you -- there are -- there are times when an event that seems maybe not that significant at the time then actually becomes a moment that fuels change, so Rosa Parks comes to mind. You know, her decision that day to not go to the back of the bus, then is the story throughout history that is representative of something. ', ""And what I heard today from the family members and others at the funeral was that they truly believe that George Floyd's name will be remembered because they do believe that there will be change. And what we heard at the top of this show is that Senator Tim Scott has been tapped by Senator Mitch McConnell to help the Republicans move forward to find some bipartisan agreement on some police reforms. "", ""And in a quick conversation with some Republicans on the Hill, they do believe that this is actually possible. So I mean, obviously, partisan politics in the middle of an election year can sometimes upend those things. But I feel like when people are all suggesting that they do believe that this is a moment, a time where something could change, that we'll look back on this, hopefully, and recognize it as one of those times. "", ""And if I could just say one other thing about -- as we watch this funeral procession. George Floyd, as we've mentioned, is going to be laid to rest next to his mother. I spent a little bit of time yesterday listening to some interviews of people who had come from many states away to be there for the public part of this memorial. And over and over again, they said that they were so moved by the fact that George Floyd called out for his mother in the last moments of his life. And there are mothers who said it really spoke to me, sons who said that meant so much to me, fathers who said they could understand it. "", 'And I also think, Brian, that one of the reasons you see this from around the world is that mothers and our reverence for mamas is an international universal feeling. And so, I think that feels very poignant right now that in this horse-drawn carriage that he will go where he wanted to be, which is next to his mom. ', ""KILMEADE: And Juan, his mom just passed away a couple of years ago. The brother said, you know, we would just get over my mom passing away and now this strikes the family, and the family unit often sustains people during this time. And in, in the African American community, they are looking on in this right now and they're reaching almost into one family. "", ""Well, I was encouraged by what Dana actually started her remarks about is that there is -- there's not a sense of I'm going to go to my corner and I think this, and I'm going to go to my corner and I'm going to think this way. I think there's an opportunity for some common ground here. "", 'And even though the Democrats started writing legislation on their own without dealing in Republicans, if there is some common ground, do you believe this far out of election, we are months away, there could be something done towards criminal justice reform or policing reform? ', ""WILLIAMS: Brian, I, you know, I was just taken, you know, emotion about what Dana said about mothers. I just thought she was on the money. So, I just wanted to say that I think that it is so universal and so significant in terms of how people speak about George Floyd's death. "", ""I mean, obviously, people say, you know, they're reminded -- remember Eric Garner and I can't breathe. But in this one, I hear from so many people about that mother themes. I just wanted to underline that. "", ""And the other aspect of this in terms of what you're saying, Brian is, there's more of a national consensus than I've ever seen. And I think it's reflected in the polling. There was polling from ABC News earlier this week that said, close to 60 percent of Americans. So that's Americans who are liberal, and conservative, black, white, Asian, Latino, say that the police are more likely to use excessive force when dealing with black men, or black people in general, but black men I think, is what we're really talking about. "", ""And they object to this. They think it's time to change this. And you hear this of course, in stories from people like Senator Scott, the only black person who is a U.S. Republican senator. But do you even hear it from his colleague, Lindsey Graham, the other South Carolina senator, who says we've got a problem. "", ""You hear it from Mitch McConnell. And a lot of people think Mitch McConnell never says anything about racial issues in our country. Mitch McConnell said, you know what? We've got to look at this. We've got a problem here. "", ""So to me, I do you think that there's the opportunity when you have such widely held consensus. The issue would be, does it hold? You mentioned we got an election coming. Partisan politics is going to start throwing mud balls. It already has. But I'm hopeful. I choose to be optimistic because I think that the American people having witnessed this and justice are truly moved and truly have some emotional feelings and want to do better. We want our better self to be reflected including in the actions of our police department. "", ""KILMEADE: Yes, so hopeful, Juan. I like that. So let's go over to Jesse. Jesse, you talked about a hopeful moment too. I also think they did in the big picture if we're looking holistically, I love law enforcement to be at the table because they have no interest in being the villains in this. "", ""Oftentimes, if you -- I remember the Baltimore situation in particular, with Freddie Gray, they talked about how few families were in nuclear families there are in Baltimore, the father and the mother. Is there any way to get back to rebuilding the family, the family in America again, and start instilling some of those values, so law enforcement doesn't end up being one of the parents? "", ""WATTERS: I think that should be a goal for all communities across this country. And we saw what happened with some of the violence in the second term of the Obama administration. You had the Ferguson effect where after these very, very hot racial shootings, the police pulled back, because they didn't want to be put into a position where they were second-guessed. And in an attempt to save a life were then vilified for policing too aggressively. And crime rates skyrocket all across the major cities in this country, including homicides, and no one wants that. Black people don't want it. White People don't want it. Hispanics don't want it. The police don't want it. Nobody wants that. "", ""So to Juan's point, we are at a consensus. And that's a good thing. And that I think it speaks to the fact that we've come so far as a country from the founding to the Civil War, all the bloodshed there, to the Civil Rights Movement, to the I Have a Dream speech, to Barack Obama being elected President of the United States. We've gotten to this moment now, where there's a horrific, unjust murder of a black man in handcuffs on the ground and the country is so outraged by it. "", ""Then it just says that this country is not as bad as people paint it to be. I mean, if you put -- if you put black and white people at a baseball game, at a football game, at a bar or restaurant, in the train station, no one has a problem with each other. We all like each other. It's just that when we get into our corners when something like this happens, and we don't know each other, we don't see each other, we don't talk to each other. You know, everyone's on pins and needles now, because they're afraid to say the wrong thing. "", ""And now silence means you're complicit in violence. So, people don't know what to do.

And that cost will be many deaths.”\nHerd Immunity is when so many people get infected with a disease that they develop antibodies to protect the population against it. This is achieved in one of two ways, Adalja said:\xa0by\xa0natural infection or vaccines.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. ', ""TUCKER CARLSON, FOX NEWS HOST: Good evening and welcome to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT. We're going to have a live update for you in just a moment on the Nation of CHAZ. That's the new breakaway Republic emerging from within downtown Seattle, Washington. "", ""Unfortunately, we've not yet secured visas to visit CHAZ, but we do have pictures of what is happening inside its borders tonight. Stay with us for that. "", ""But first, on Wednesday, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts proposed an amendment to the Annual Defense Funding Bill. Warren's wording would order The Pentagon to rename all military bases that are currently named for Confederate Civil War generals. Those bases include many of the most famous in the country, Fort Benning in Georgia, Fort Hood in Texas, Fort Bragg in North Carolina. "", ""You may have trained on one of those bases, the men who fought and won World War II did, but Warren's amendment goes farther than just renaming bases. Warren would also require the desecration of war graves. "", 'This country is filled with national cemeteries that honor Americans who fought and died in our wars and many of those cemeteries hold Civil War soldiers from both sides and contain monuments to their sacrifice. ', 'Those soldiers blue and gray Confederate and Union are buried alongside one another and they are for a reason. One side in that conflict was right, the union side and the other was wrong, the Confederate side. ', 'But when it was over, they were all Americans again and allowing them to lie in the same cemeteries next to each other allowed this country to heal its deepest fissure. ', ""But healing is the opposite of what Elizabeth Warren wants to do now. She has no time for healing. Warren profits from hatred and division, particularly racial division, no matter how mindless. Exactly how many dead Confederate soldiers own slaves or even supported slavery? Elizabeth Warren doesn't know. She doesn't care to know. "", 'She wants to humiliate them 150 years after they died, and more to the point their descendants now. ', ""In Arlington National Cemetery just outside Washington, there is a memorial to Confederate troops. Warren's amendment orders the army to tear it down. "", ""This is vandalism, obviously, but it's worse and deeper than that. Healthy societies do not destroy their own history. A country is the sum total of what has happened within it -- good and bad. Without history, you have no country. You just have a collection of banks and check cashing outlets and retail stores. "", ""All of us may have iPhones, but that's not a country. It's obvious. But somehow it's not obvious to Senate Republicans. They support Elizabeth Warren's amendment. The amendment easily emerged from the bipartisan Senate Armed Services Committee. "", ""If the President doesn't veto it, Warren's desecration will become law. Republicans are fine with that. They assume if it does become law, it will be enough, the mob will be sated. The destroyers will have gotten what they wanted and the G.O.P. can return to its preferred agenda for carrying water for big finance. "", ""But they're mistaken in this, because it's never enough. Extremists are never placated. In fact, every success makes them stronger and makes them more radical. We're watching it now. That's why around the country, mobs are not waiting for a vote to destroy history. "", ""They watch rioters loot and burn without being punished, and they took the cue. Now, they're destroying history in many states. "", ""In Richmond, for example, they ripped a statue of Christopher Columbus from its pedestal, and they threw it in a lake. They didn't explain what that might have to do with police brutality. In Philadelphia, they vandalized a statue of an industrialist called Matthias Baldwin. Why him? Well, it wasn't for Civil Rights. "", ""In fact, Matthias Baldwin was such a zealous abolitionist, that before the Civil War, the southern railroads refused to buy his engines. He was on the right side. It doesn't matter. Baldwin lived a long time ago. The statue to him was old, so they wrecked it. It's Year Zero. Nothing that came before can remain. "", ""For that reason, dozens of other monuments have suffered the same fate. Often with the encouragement of our professional class. They're cheering it on, as they always do. "", 'Erin Thompson for example is Professor of Art Crime at New York\'s John Jay College of Criminal Justice, she says her expertise is, quote, ""The damage done to humanity shared heritage through looting, theft, and the deliberate destruction of art."" ', 'And yet because everything is irony, Professor Thompson is herself an enthusiastic supporter of destroying our shared heritage in this country, quote, ""Use chain instead of rope and it\'ll go faster."" The Professor instructed on Twitter Wednesday night, then she shared even more tips for effectively destroying our monuments. ', 'Nowhere does anyone in authority seem interested in protecting our history and protecting our public spaces from nihilists like Professor Thompson and the mobs she commands. ', ""The police memorial in Richmond, Virginia commemorates the sacrifice of officers killed in the line of duty. It has nothing to do with the Confederacy. You'd think our leaders would defend it, but no, they didn't. The other day, a mob defaced that memorial, and authorities did nothing. "", ""What are our leaders telling us by their negligence in the face of the mob? They're sending a very clear message, which is this. We don't care about you. We don't care about the country. We don't care about your history, your monuments, your rights, or your safety. "", 'Meanwhile, forces of hate and repression are destroying all of these things. As far back as three years ago, CNN employees were calling for the destruction of the Washington Monument and the Jefferson Memorial. ', '(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ', ""ANGELA RYE, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: American History is not all glorious, and even though I love John to death, I couldn't disagree more about George Washington. George Washington was a slave owner and we need to call slave owners out for what they are, whether we think they were protecting American freedom or not, he wasn't protecting my freedom. "", ""I wasn't someone who my ancestors weren't deemed human beings to him. And so to me, I don't care if it's a George Washington statue or a Thomas Jefferson statue or a Robert E. Lee statue, they all need to come down. "", '(END VIDEO CLIP) ', 'CARLSON: Yes. Thanks for the lecture, idiot. It may happen by the way, at this rate it will, the Washington Monument will be torn down with chains, not ropes. The Jefferson Memorial, too. When that happens, how many lives will be improved? How many people will be happier and will get better jobs? How many will be improved by the desecration of War Graves? ', ""The answer, of course, is none. It's not about improving the lives of anyone of any color, it is about political power. Political power achieved by the oldest means of all force. It's an attempt to legitimize you who vote the wrong way and the society you live in which they hate and want to control. "", ""You think you live in a country with freedom of speech, freedom of religion, equality guaranteed under law. Tough. The documents that celebrate those rights that enshrine them were written by bigots. We tore their statues down. Now, we're in charge. "", ""Is anyone for this, exactly? Anyone? The American people want this? No. Even now, in the middle of our cultural revolution, only 32 percent of Americans say they want Civil War statuary torn down. How about desecrating War Graves? There's no polling on the subject that we could find, but it's hard to believe there's a groundswell of support for this. "", ""Millions of people don't have jobs. Why are we spending time on this? Well, it's happening because a violent mob is forcing its agenda down the throat of our country. Our leaders very much, including Mitch McConnell, and other Republicans in the Senate are too cowardly to resist them. "", 'When asked about the Bill to desecrate national cemeteries, one congressional Republican told journalist Ryan Girdusky, quote, ""This isn\'t the hill to die on."" OK, so where is that hill exactly? What won\'t you let them do to the country? Let us know when you find out. ', ""Now to be clear, because there's no question this will become trending on Twitter, we are not defending the southern Confederacy. We abhor it. Few Americans would defend the southern confederacy and again, we certainly wouldn't. The Confederacy declared war on the United States. We are grateful they lost and that their cause was discredited forever by losing, and it was discredited. "", ""But that's the whole point. The Civil War was the turning point in American history. It shaped who we are now. Eliminating the past leaves us unable to say who we are and that's the point of eliminating it. It's exactly why they're doing it. "", 'Joey Jones is a retired Marine Staff Sergeant, he joins us tonight. Joey, thanks so much for coming on. Just to be completely clear. ', 'JOHNNY ""JOEY"" JONES, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Good to be here, Tucker. Yes. ', ""CARLSON: This is a form of moral blackmail, in which they use the term confederacy and people are paralyzed. But the truth is, they're trying to destroy evidence of what came before of our history -- good and bad. What does that do to the country? "", 'JONES: You know, I served eight years in the Marine Corps and I never thought twice about what our bases were named after other than the one that was named after a Commandant of the Marine Corps. ', ""And what I'm trying to say there is that what matters today is what in fact, things that happen on us today. So, I don't care about these Confederate generals, I care that Fort Benning is where you go, and you learn how to be an Army Infantryman and you go win a war that saves half the Western world from Nazis. That's what's important. "", ""You know, I don't know what kind of future you're building by tearing down statues so that you offend one half of the people while appeasing the other. But what you can do is bring communities together and build new memorials and build new statues and build a future that looks more like who we are, perhaps, and I'm OK with that conversation. "", ""But to just offend half the people so you can appease the other half, that only divides us, and what it really does is it gives a whole group of politicians an opportunity to say, look, see what I did for you there? Now go vote for me, while their minions go and say, see what your politicians didn't do for you, come to our side. That's what this is really all about. "", ""You stir people's emotions, and you get them to think about stuff that they haven't thought about for a hundred years so that you can divide them and win votes. "", ""CARLSON: Divide them, so I guess what you're saying is this isn't really an effort to bring us together as a nation. It's an effort to divide us along tribal lines. "", ""JONES: That's exactly right. I live in Georgia. I was raised in the south and there was a certain affection for the rebel battle flag growing up that I grew out of, because I joined the United States Marine Corps, and I learned there's only one flag available for my heart, and that's the American flag. "", ""CARLSON: That's right. Amen. "", ""JONES: And you don't get there through bands and taking things out in the middle of the night. You get there through dialogue and communication. What we have now are excuses for leaders trying to draw lines in the sand and they dare is to cross the line. "", ""Where are those leaders that understand building a future together isn't tearing down our past? I don't care what you do with the statues and the rebel flag, but I do care how you lead and where you're going to take us. "", ""That's what's most important to me and you don't go into the future of rebuilding our communities by tearing down statues. That's not how this works. "", ""CARLSON: Well, I strongly agree and appreciate your point about one flag, it is the American flag, you know, under which we all stand. They are against the American flag, though. They have no problem people flying the flag of foreign countries, the Mexican flag at political riots, I find that repugnant, not because I hate Mexico, but because this isn't Mexico, it's America. "", ""I don't understand how they are banning, when it's fine if they, you know, ban on the flags you want, but why they're trying to ban the American flag? That's the one flag you shouldn't ban, correct? "", ""JONES: Well, we don't need to ban anything. We need to look forward and say who are we and what do we stand for? When they came after the Betsy Ross flag, I had it tattooed on my right bicep, not because I knew Betsy Ross but because that was the first step towards the country we have today. "", ""We're only going to get better along the way. And I don't know one person that feels like we're a better country because we're taking down a statue, but I know a lot of people that might feel energized and inspired for the next memorial and monument we put up and a leader that comes forth because right now that's not what we have. "", ""CARLSON: Why don't these people build something once in a while? I can't remember the last thing Elizabeth Warren built or any of the mobs built. They're incapable of building. They're totally incompetent. Good luck running the power grid, by the way. We're looking at -- "", 'JONES: Yes, my dad was -- ', ""CARLSON: Joey, we're looking at pictures now live of a statue -- I don't even know what statue it is. It is something old. It's being pulled down. Wilmington, Delaware, right on 95 there on the Eastern Seaboard. Unbelievable. "", ""JONES: What are we doing there? Right?

CHAZ's gleaming capital rises from land that once belonged to an indigenous, but now nearly extinct tribe known as the Seattle Police Department. "", ""As with so many great nations, the creation story of CHAZ holds innumerable lessons for all of us. It's a tale of unlikely good fortune and the triumph of perseverance over hardship. "", ""How do a group of people with new useful skills, no record of achievement or personal hygiene, a group capable smashing windows and setting fires, but nothing else. How does a group like that create an entirely new nation? That's a question we may soon face here in the United States, in fact, given our current trajectory, it's never easy to build things with people who can only destroy. "", ""And yet, CHAZ pulled it off with grit and determination. This plucky little nation managed to give birth to itself and in the process, a whole new era of democratic self-government. OK, that's overstatement. They haven't actually built anything in CHAZ, it is still mostly graffiti and discarded Starbucks cups, nor is it fully a democracy. "", ""In fact, the country is run by a warlord/rapper called Raz, whose last paying job was renting out his own apartment on Airbnb. It is in other words, a work in progress. But CHAZ does have one functioning institution, it is the Department of Agriculture. It's up and running. "", ""Chaztanians are a proud, independent people and they plan to feed themselves.

The fact that they're living there and they've actually, you know, built their own little city or town or country, whatever it is. "", ""And they have to figure out how to make it work and it is slowly dawning on them that they would end up recreating all the systems that they opposed because nobody has a better idea.

Like I say that, you know, a lot of our systems were designed before the internet, you know, are you telling me we can't design a better policing system., still with some police, you still need some muscle sometimes, but you couldn't design something that's better using all the technology that's been designed since the first police officer wore a badge? "", ""CARLSON: So, I guess, I would just say though, this isn't really bad.

"", ""What did we learn? We learned that hospitals can't be overwhelmed. We learned we need a lot of testing for COVID-19 in the United States.

So, if you -- and there is a much better quality of life, for raising families, to homeschool your kids if you want. You get a little dirt under your fingernails. And again, find opportunity. You know find opportunity like, you know, the brandy that I'm launching, which is phenomenal. And you know, it sold out its first release. "", ""You know -- you just -- if you look and you pay attention and you know, you stay open to the signs of where opportunity are, it's all over this country. It's the greatest country in the world.
