De Blasio’s ‘Contact Tracing Team’ Isn’t Allowed To Ask COVID-19 Patients If They Attended A Protest,2020/06/15,https://dailycaller.com/2020/06/15/de-blasio-contact-tracing-covid-19-patients-protest-coronavirus-george-floyd/,"Democratic New York City Mayor Bill De Blasio’s “contact tracing team” won’t be allowed to ask COVID-19 patients if they attended a George Floyd protest recently, The City reported. 

The “contact tracing team” is tasked with finding an infected patient’s recent contacts and informing them about their exposure to the virus so they can self-isolate. However, the team is not allowed to ask people if they attended one of the many recent demonstrations where thousands of people gathered closely together to protest the death of George Floyd, The City reported.

Instead, the team was instructed to ask general questions so the coronavirus patients can “proactively offer” information about attending a demonstration. (RELATED: New York City Mayor Bill De Blasio’s Daughter Called Him Out On His ‘White Privilege’)

Avery Cohen, a spokesperson for the mayor, told The City that the questions are intended to help patients “recall ‘contacts’ and individuals they may have exposed,” saying in an email that “no person will be asked proactively if they attended a protest.”

Individuals who test positive for COVID-19 are asked for information about who lives in their home and their “recent contacts,” without being asked whether or not those contacts occurred at a protest, Cohen added.


Cohen said that “there is an opportunity” for coronavirus patients to “proactively offer” information about attending a protest if they choose to do so.

De Blasio hired 1,000 workers to do contact tracing for people who test positive for COVID-19 in order to stop the spread of the virus. New York City was the hotbed of the pandemic outbreak in the United States and struggled with an overwhelmed health care system and skyrocketing case numbers. 

De Blasio expressed concern over the potential spread of coronavirus from mass gatherings during protests over the death of George Floyd, a black man who died after a police officer knelt on his neck for several minutes. 

The mayor said during a June 1 press conference that “For those who have already had their presence and made their voices heard, the safest thing to do is to stay home,” according to ABC 7 News. 


“Obviously we don’t want people in close proximity to each other, we don’t want people out there where they might catch this disease or spread this disease,” the mayor added. 

During a press conference Thursday, de Blasio said “playgrounds just created too much of a risk to families, of the spread of the disease.” When asked if he would say the same about protests, he said “the moment that this city, this nation has gone through in the last two weeks or so is something very particular, very painful, very intense, very challenging.”

“But also a moment where literally decades and centuries of the demand for change came forward, and real change is happening as a result,” the mayor added.

Dr. Anthony Fauci, a key member of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, told WTOP the protests are “the perfect set up for the spread of the virus in the sense of creating some blips which might turn into some surges,” which is “really of concern.”",Daily Caller
North Dakota’s Coronavirus Tracking App Admits To Violating Its Own Privacy Policy,2020/05/22,https://dailycaller.com/2020/05/22/contact-tracing-apple-google-coronavirus/,"North Dakota and South Dakota’s contact tracing application violated its own privacy policy after it shared user data to a third company, an analysis published Thursday showed.

Both states relied on North Dakota app maker ProudCrowd to make Care19 free of charge to anyone with an Apple or Google Android, The Washington Post reported. The report was based on an analysis from privacy software maker Jumbo, which found that the app maker shared data to FourSquare, a location-data provider for marketers.


“Should this have been vetted? Yes. We are following up on that as we speak,” Vern Dosch, North Dakota’s contact-tracing officer, told WaPo. “We know that people are very sensitive.”

Neither Apple nor the South Dakota Health Department have responded to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s requests for comment. Apple told WaPo that it’s investigating the review.

ProudCrowd confirmed to WaPo that the app shared some non-commercial use data with FourSquare. The Google Android version of Care19 obscures the data it shares to FourSquare, ProudCrowd said. (RELATED: Sen Hawley Asks Big Tech Not To Hide Behind Their ‘Corporate Shield’ On Privacy Issues)

Foursquare does “not use the data in any way and it is promptly discarded,” spokeswoman Jennifer Yu told WaPo. “Essentially, any data we might receive is immediately discarded.”


Care19 reminded people where they’ve been so they can retrace their steps and determine if they’ve been in contact with someone who tested positive for coronavirus, which originated in Wuhan, China, before spreading to the United States, where it has reportedly killed nearly 100,000 people.

If users test COVID-19 positive, then they can use the app to share data with the state’s Department of Health. The app is voluntary.

Care19 uses a Foursquare service called Pilgrim SDK to convert location data as latitude and longitude into the names of recognizable places, according to the app’s maker, Tim Brookins of ProudCrowd.

“The Care19 application user interface clearly calls out the usage of Foursquare on our ‘Nearby Places’ screen, per the terms of our Foursquare agreement,” Brookins told WaPo. “We will be working with our state partners to be more explicit in our privacy policy.”


Lawmakers worry big tech companies are not doing enough to protect privacy data as they work to deploy contact tracing technology.

“If it doesn’t have a strong privacy framework, it will undermine consumer confidence,” Democratic Sen. Maria Cantwell of Washington told WaPo.",Daily Caller
WHO Says It’s ‘Rare’ For An Asymptomatic Person To Spread Coronavirus,2020/06/08,https://dailycaller.com/2020/06/08/world-health-organization-asymptomatic-spread-coronavirus/,"World Health Organization (WHO) officials said Monday that it’s rare for infected people without symptoms to spread the coronavirus, according to CNBC. 

The possibility of people who have coronavirus but don’t have any symptoms transmitting the virus to others influenced policies like mask requirements and strict social distancing measures. 


Questions have been raised in recent weeks about the idea that coronavirus is spread by asymptomatic carriers. A Chinese study in late May found that asymptomatic coronavirus patients were contagious for a shorter period of time than patients with symptoms. Now, the head of WHO’s diseases and zoonosis unit Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove said Monday that asymptomatic spread is “very rare.”

“From the data we have, it still seems to be rare that an asymptomatic person actually transmits onward to a secondary individual,” she said according to CNBC. 

“What we really want to be focused on is following the symptomatic cases,” she said, adding that if we would “drastically reduce“ the outbreak if we isolated symptomatic coronavirus patients and used contact tracing to isolate individuals that had been in contact with the patient. (RELATED: Study: Coronavirus Might Have Hit China ‘Late Summer’ Or ‘Early Fall’)

“We have a number of reports from countries who are doing very detailed contact tracing,” she said. “They’re following asymptomatic cases. They’re following contacts. And they’re not finding secondary transmission onward. It’s very rare.”

She noted that some studies have shown evidence of asymptomatic spread in nursing homes or within a household, but that more research is needed.

Accounting for the possibility of presymptomatic or asymptomatic transmission was a major influence on policies put in place to control the pandemic. 

The CDC said in early April that presymptomatic transmission “increases the challenges of containment measures,” and that “public health officials conducting contact tracing should strongly consider including a period before symptom onset to account for the possibility of presymptomatic transmission.”


“The potential for presymptomatic transmission underscores the importance of social distancing, including the avoidance of congregate settings, to reduce COVID-19 spread,” the CDC report read. “These findings suggest that to control the pandemic it might not be enough for only persons with symptoms to limit their contact with others because persons without symptoms might transmit infection.”",Daily Caller
Gretchen Whitmer Distanced Herself From Coronavirus Contract Awarded To Democratic Firms. New Email Shows Her Office Gave It ‘Green Light’,2020/05/27,https://dailycaller.com/2020/05/27/gretchen-whitmer-coronavirus-tracing-contract-democratic-firm/,"Democratic Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer distanced herself from a much-criticized decision to award a no-bid contract to two Democratic firms to handle the state’s coronavirus contact tracing.

But a senior adviser in the Michigan Department of the Health and Human Services said that the executive office of the governor [EOG] gave the contract a “green light,” a newly public email shows.

“We got the green light from EOG to move forward with a slightly different organizational arrangement of the contact tracing volunteer work,” Andrea Taverna, the senior adviser, told her colleagues in an April 17 email obtained and published by Bridge Magazine.

“This would still be working with Mike Kolehouse, so work there isn’t lost — it’s just organized somewhat differently,” Taverna wrote.

Kolehouse is a Democratic political consultant who runs Great Lakes Community Engagement, the firm that received the no-bid contract from the Whitmer administration. Kolehouse’s firm planned to hire a Democratic data firm working on Whitmer’s re-election campaign as a sub-contractor on the project.

Whitmer, who is on former Vice President Joe Biden’s short list of potential running mates, canceled the project April 21 after facing criticism. (RELATED: Whitmer Calls Husband’s Request For Special Treatment A ‘Failed Attempt At Humor)


Her press secretary told The Washington Post that same day that the governor’s office was “uncomfortable” with the arrangement.

“The executive office is uncomfortable with this vendor for the same reason others are. The public needs to have confidence that this tracing work is being done by a nonpartisan firm,” press secretary Tiffany Brown told the Post.

The next day, April 22, Whitmer distanced herself from the decision to hire the Democratic firm.

“The department thought that that vendor was the best one for some reason. I don’t know what that reason was, but I do know that the Department of Health and Human Services does not have a political bone in their theoretical body,” the governor said. “When it was brought to my attention, I told them to cancel it.”


“The vendor was identified and ultimately approved by officials with DHHS and MPHI, not the executive office,” Brown told the Daily Caller News Foundation in an email.

“The communications director responded to a question in an email about the optics of using a vendor that does work primarily for non-profits. He was not approving a contract. Based on a previous phone conversation, he raised concerns that using a political vendor would be a distraction from the important work that needed to be done,” she added.

“To be clear, the communications director is not in the approval chain of department contracts and the full expectation was and has always been that the department would follow its procurement process.”",Daily Caller
Ex-FDA Head Scott Gottlieb Releases New Plan For Reopening Economy,2020/05/01,https://dailycaller.com/2020/05/01/fda-gottlieb-coronavirus-congress/,"Former FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb detailed a new plan for reopening the economy this week, urging Congress to ramp up income protection and encourage more self-isolation.

Gottlieb, who left the Trump administration in 2019, co-signed the letter with more than a dozen other medical officials, and its recommendations largely line up with messaging coming out of the White House Coronavirus Task Force. Critical to Gottlieb’s plan is increased funding for contact tracing programs, which he says are essential for preventing resurgent outbreaks. The entirety of the plan would cost the U.S. $46.5 billion. (RELATED: ‘China Was Not Truthful’: Ex-FDA Chief Scott Gottlieb Explains How Beijing Misled The World About Coronavirus)


“To begin to safely ease at-home measures, it is of paramount importance to be able to provide broad, timely testing for COVID-19; diagnose COVID-19 positive cases; enable infected individuals to self-isolate at home or voluntarily in other facilities; trace and alert those who have been exposed to an infected individual; and enable those exposed contacts to voluntarily self-isolate for 14 days after their last exposure to the infected person,” the letter reads.

The increased tracing program would cost roughly $12 million, according to the plan’s estimates, and it would recommend that anyone who comes in contact with an infected person self-isolate for at least 14 days. For those who cannot safely self-isolate in their homes, Gottlieb’s plan recommends the federal government or states lease out vacant hotels for people to self-isolate voluntarily. (RELATED: REPORT: Trump’s Push To Hurry Coronavirus Vaccine Is Called ‘Operation Warp Speed’)

“There is substantial evidence that providing a voluntary option to safely isolate will help to dramatically reduce spread of infection to one’s family and therefore the spread of infection overall,” the plan says. “We believe 14 percent of infected individuals and exposed contacts will need such an option. Hotels are largely sitting idle at present and can provide local options for such voluntary self-isolation sites.”

The assisted self-isolation portion of the plan is estimated to cost $4.5 billion, and the income protection that self-isolation makes necessary would cost $30 billion over the course of 18 months.


The plan’s announcement letter was addressed to Republican and Democratic leaders in the House and Senate, but none have confirmed whether the plan will be incorporated into additional coronavirus relief bills.

“We believe the direct impact of this investment, along with an adequate testing and containment infrastructure that links in health care providers and businesses, will have a significant economic impact, allowing Americans to get back to work safely and quickly, create employment, stabilize our healthcare system, and stimulate the hospitality sector,” the doctors said in the letter. “It is imperative that states and metropolitan areas are able to quickly begin and scale this important work, and we urge you to make this commitment as a part of the next stimulus legislation.”",Daily Caller
Former Nevada AG Adam Laxalt: Gretchen Whitmer Could Be ‘In Big Trouble’ For No-Bid Contract Attempt,2020/04/23,https://dailycaller.com/2020/04/23/adam-laxalt-gretchen-whitmer-big-trouble/,"Former Nevada Attorney General Adam Laxalt said Democratic Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer could be “in big trouble” for attempting to give a no-bid contract to a Democratic political operation.

Whitmer’s administration admitted earlier this week that “normal protocols were bypassed when a no-bid contract for coronavirus contact tracing was awarded by the state to Great Lakes Community Engagement, which is operated by a well-known Democratic consultant Michael Kolehouse,” Fox News reported.


“Great Lakes Community Engagement isn’t a neutral company fluent in health statistics, it’s a political operation founded by a Democratic political consultant” that intended to use technology from a firm that provides tech “for almost every Democratic campaign in a America,” said Fox News host Tucker Carlson before introducing Laxalt. “Imagine, gathering information from the people of Michigan under the pretext of public health and sending it to a Democratic campaign outfit. That’s what Gretchen Whitmer tried to do with tax dollars.”

WATCH:



“I think she could be in big trouble,” Laxalt told Carlson. “Let’s see what happened here, so this contract gets awarded to this Democratic group, and politics and your official office are never supposed to overlap.”


After noting that Michigan is “one of the only states in America where the governor and the legislature are exempted from Freedom of Information Act requests,” Laxalt said Whitmer’s adminstration “already rejected” his organization’s request. He nevertheless promised to “FOIA every state entity that should have touched a state contract.”

“And that’s where we could find the real trouble,” he said. “Did they go through the hurdles they should have to pass the state contact?”

“And I would add one interesting thing, any contract over $250,000 goes to a public board that the governor sits on, the Attorney General sits on,” said Laxalt, who also ran unsuccessfully for governor of Nevada in 2018. “The public could have seen it, they could’ve asked questions. Magically this thing ends up under that threshold so, lo and behold it doesn’t go to a public board. So there’s a lot of questions to be answered and of course the governor could clear this up by simply releasing these records and letting the public know exactly how this contract came about.” (RELATED: ‘Gretchen Whitmer Is A Ghoul’: Tucker Wonders Why ‘People Rotting In Wheelchairs’ Is Allowed But Abortion Is ‘Essential’)

The former Nevada AG also expressed interest in finding out whether or not the contract was pulled “the right way.”

De Blasio Picks Hospital Chief Who Downplayed COVID Risk To Lead Virus Tracking: Report,2020/05/15,https://dailycaller.com/2020/05/15/bill-de-blasio-new-york-coronavirus/,"New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio is tapping the head of the city’s public hospital system to lead his virus contact tracing effort two months after the official advised the mayor’s office to avoid lockdowns and instead let the virus take its course, according to The New York Time.

De Blasio took away New York City’s health department’s authority to oversee contract tracing recently and gave the job to the head of the city public hospital system, Mitchell Katz, the NYT reported Thursday.


Health officials are upset about the move, the NYT reported, arguing Katz’s office does not have the capacity to marshal the kind of tools needed to carry out the effort.

Some officials are also upset about Katz’s past comments suggesting lockdowns would do more harm than good, the NYT reported. (RELATED: FLASHBACK To March 3: De Blasio Asks New Yorkers To Ignore Coronavirus, Get On With Their Lives)

“We have to accept that unless a vaccine is rapidly developed, large numbers of people will get infected,” Katz wrote in a March 10 email to the mayor’s office, which was obtained by the NYT. “The good thing is greater than 99 percent will recover without harm. Once people recover they will have immunity. The immunity will protect the herd.”

Italy “is having a terrible problem that I do not believe we will have,” Katz wrote, arguing also that shutting down events could create fear among some with mental health issues.

The mayor selected Health and Hospitals system Katz leads because it’s a quasi-private organization, and that structure allows the government to hire people and award contracts faster than the Health Department, the NYT reported.

“The ability to rely on the organizational infrastructure that (Health and Hospitals) brings is also essential,” de Blasio press secretary Freddi Goldstein told the NYT, referring to the city hospital system.

Still, some officials are critical of the move.

“It is a head-scratcher. I can’t figure out the rationale, and I don’t think it’s worth the risks,” Stanley Brezenoff, who temporarily lead Health and Hospitals in 2016, told the NYT.


New York City’s coronavirus death toll hit 20,000 on Thursday, while more than 40,000 people have reportedly died from the illness in the state of New York. More than 85,000 Americans have died from COVID-19 so far.

Katz gave “the best advice based on what they knew at that time,” de Blasio spokeswoman Goldstein said of the March 10 email, adding that the mayor sought advice from several experts. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention “repeatedly misled us and greatly hampered our ability to catch and respond to this disease,” Goldstein added.

De Blasio did not impose stay-at-home orders until a week after Katz’s email, the NYT reported.

De Blasio asked his citizens to move on with their lives as the pandemic spread across the globe in February and early March. “Since I’m encouraging New Yorkers to go on with your lives + get out on the town despite Coronavirus,” de Blasio told his Twitter followers on March 3.

De Blasio offered some suggestions for what New Yorkers should do instead of social distancing. “I thought I would offer some suggestions. Here’s the first: thru Thurs 3/5 go see ‘The Traitor,'” he said, referring to a 2019 crime drama about the life and times of a Mafia mob boss. ",Daily Caller

Brown, in a prepared statement, described the temporary measure as a “yellow light,” saying that it would remain in place for seven days.

“This one-week pause will give public health experts time to assess what factors are driving the spread of the virus and determine if we need to adjust our approach to reopening,” she said.

Officials have attributed some of the additional cases to the widespread availability of testing, increased contact tracing, active monitoring of cases and recent workplace outbreaks, according to the Los Angeles Times.

Areas in the state that have had their applications to reopen put on hold include Multnomah County, which includes Portland, Hood River County, Marion County and Polk County. (RELATED: University Of Oregon Intends To Be Open In The Fall)

“As we expected, the number of cases [is] going up,” OHA Director Patrick Allen said in a news conference Thursday. “The question has always been, can we manage in a way that doesn’t prevent the cases from going up but prevents it from overwhelming our systems.”

The holds come amid large protests that have occurred throughout much of the state. Allen issued a reminder Thursday urging Oregonians to continue to social distance, wash their hands adequately and wear a mask when out in public.

While Oregon is not the only state to report an increase in confirmed coronavirus cases, its decision to temporarily pause its reopening stands in contrast to other states, including Texas, Florida, and Arizona.

"Japan To Lift State Of Emergency, Says Economy Is Now Top Priority",2020/05/25,https://dailycaller.com/2020/05/25/japan-state-emergency-economy-priority-coronavirus-abe-reopening/,"Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said Monday in a news conference that Japan was lifting its coronavirus state of emergency as cases have dropped, telling reporters that their focus has shifted to prioritize reviving the economy. 

“We have largely brought the infection under control in a month and a half,” Abe said at a news conference, Bloomberg News reported. “Every area of the country has met the conditions for reopening.” Japan reported fewer than 70 new cases last week. 


The first state of emergency was officially declared April 7, and restrictions have been lifting gradually in parts of the country since mid-May. Tokyo, the country’s capital, and some surrounding cities were the last places to have the state of emergency lifted Monday. 

He said the government was working on a new spending package to help businesses and workers who suffered financial hardships as a result of the pandemic. The prime minister also said the country has spent over 200 trillion yen, or $1.86 trillion U.S. dollars, on economic aid. 

There may be a second wave, Abe added, which means the state of emergency might have to be reinstated. Regions would be assessed every three weeks to determine if they could continue to reopen. (RELATED: Japan’s Deputy Prime Minister Says The WHO Should Change Name To The China Health Organization)

Japan has been criticized by some for its coronavirus response. The state of emergency allowed local governments to enforce lockdowns without much of a centralized response. Japan tested just 0.2% of the population, and many businesses stayed open. Regardless, they were successful in slowing the spread of the virus and reported fewer than 1,000 deaths. 

Cultural factors may have played a part in preventing the spread of coronavirus. In Japan, citizens do not shake hands, shoes are removed before entering a household, masks are commonly worn during cold and flu season, and the population practices good personal hygiene. 

People wearing masks wait to cross a road in the Shibuya district on February 02, 2020 in Tokyo, Japan. Japan reported 20 cases of Wuhan coronavirus infections as the number of those who have died from the virus, known as 2019-nCoV, in China climbed to over 300 and cases have been reported in other countries including the United States, Canada, Australia, Japan, South Korea, India, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, and several others.

Experts have claimed that Japan’s low rate of obesity and universal healthcare system have also helped slow the spread, according to The Guardian. 

Assistant Director of Tokyo Medical and Dental University hospital Ryuji Koike told The Guardian that the declining infection rates were probably not “due to government policies.”

“I think it looks like Japan is doing well thanks to things that can’t be measured, like daily habits and ‘Japanese behavior’,” Koike said. 


Japan responded quickly to the potential dangers of mass gatherings and closed theaters, museums and theme parks early on. Schools were closed in early March, which reportedly sparked criticism from some who declared the closings “unnecessary.” 

Contact tracing has also been touted as a reason for Japan’s success. The country’s public health care system employs nurses who are contact tracing experts, who had already been practicing contact tracing during the typical flu season. They began contact tracing as soon as the virus hit in January.",Daily Caller
Trump White House Rolls Out New Blueprint For Expanding Coronavirus Testing In Every State,2020/04/27,https://dailycaller.com/2020/04/27/trump-new-plan-expanding-coronavirus-testing/,"President Donald Trump officially unveiled on Monday a new “blueprint” for expanding coronavirus testing capacities as states begin to reopen businesses.

The president, speaking to reporters in the White House rose Garden, that “our blueprint establishes testing platforms to detect local outbreaks and conduct contact tracing.”

“We have it all,” Trump stated. “We are deploying the full power and strength of the federal government to help states, cities, to help local government get this horrible plague over with and over with fast.” (RELATED: Trump Administration Doesn’t Want Businesses To Be On The Hook In Coronavirus Liability Suits — But How Will They Actually Be Protected?)

Dr. Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus task force’s response coordinator explained that the plan features three core elements:

Robust diagnostic testing plans
Timely monitoring systems
Rapid response programs.
“The blueprint lays out roles and responsibilities to enhance our partnership between the private and public sector, bringing together state and local governments with the federal government to make sure we can accomplish and achieve our core principles and objectives,” she added.


“We will be able to supply every state with supplies and tests they need to dramatically increase the number of tests we have done to this point,” Adm. Brett Giroir also told the gathered group of reporters. “To give you an idea, the supplies we will be providing to states, the minimum we are supplying, will be doubled in that month than the Republic of Korea has performed in the four months until now, accumulated.”

Trump held a conference call with state governors earlier on Monday during which he previewed the guidelines.

The new plan comes roughly two weeks after the White House delivered its three-phased plan to reopen the economy to each of the 50 states. The second two phases of the plan all require strict monitoring of populations returning to work in order to stem the resurgence of coronavirus.

Trump emphasized Monday that he wants businesses to reopen as quickly as possible before clarifying they need to do it “safely.”

"South Koreans Return To School, Some Quickly Sent Back Home After More Cases Arise",2020/05/20,https://dailycaller.com/2020/05/20/south-korea-students-school-sent-home-coronavirus-outbreak-new-cases/,"High school seniors returned to school in South Korea Wednesday, but some were quickly sent home when new cases were reported in the schools. 

Reopened schools are following standard safety precautions. Students and teachers are required to wear masks, and students are temperature checked and use hand sanitizer before entering the buildings. But despite the safety measures, two students were found to have coronavirus, and students were sent home in some schools the same day they were reopened, the Associated Press reported. 

Although the two students who tested positive did not return to school Wednesday, officials decided to send students home and temporarily close 66 schools in Incheon, a city west of Seoul, as a precautionary measure, the city’s Metropolitan City Office of Education said. 

In Anseong, south of Seoul, students were supposed to return to school Thursday but were told to stay home until health officials finished compiling a list of all the places that a new coronavirus patient had visited.

Health authorities in South Korea reported the largest jump in new coronavirus cases in a week Wednesday morning. 32 new cases were reported, bringing South Korea’s total case number to 11,110, according to AP. 

Senior quarantine official Kwon Jun-wook told reporters that South Korea was confident they could contain new outbreaks as schools begin to reopen, according to the Associated Press report.  “We cannot avoid initial confusion and anxiety but I believe we can overcome those as we’ve been calmly and swiftly handling and containing COVID-19,” she said. 

South Korea has been one of the most successful countries in the world at containing the outbreak, reporting fewer than 300 deaths. The country used aggressive contact tracing to isolate people who were at risk of contracting the virus, and within two weeks of its peak in February, new daily cases fell from 800 to 100 per day, according to The Atlantic. 

Education ministry officials said that students will be sent home immediately if their school reports a new case of the virus, AP reported.  

Education superintendent Cho Hee-yeon used thermometers to test students’ temperatures as they entered Seoul’s Kyungbock High School, where signs reading “no outsiders are allowed to enter the school premises” were displayed. 

She told reporters that in Seoul, she is “here to see students returning to school while praying that there won’t be any coronavirus patients among our students in 2,200 schools.” ",Daily Caller
‘I’m Not Going To Let You Make A Political Speech’: Sherrod Brown Scolds Steve Mnuchin During Hearing,2020/05/19,https://dailycaller.com/2020/05/19/sherrod-brown-scolds-steve-mnuchin-during-hearing-coronavirus-economy/,"Democratic Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown cut off Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, saying that he would not allow a “political speech” during Tuesday’s hearing on the coronavirus economy.

The exchange grew heated as the two sparred over the Trump administration’s efforts to lessen the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic and ensuing stay-at-home orders. (RELATED: Democrats Celebrate As Bill Compelling Doctors To Save Newborns Dies In The Senate)


WATCH:



“It’s not safe to reopen the economy until we have worker protections in place that will control the spread of COVID,” Brown began, saying that President Donald Trump had failed to lead on issues such as testing and contact tracing.

“How many workers will die if we send people back to work without the protections they need?” Brown asked.


Mnuchin responded by saying that no one intended to send anyone back into the workplace without laying out safety guidelines and medical advice. He noted that he had been prepared to testify in the Senate wearing a mask if necessary.

“How many workers should give their lives to increase our GDP by half a percent? There is no national program to provide worker safety. The president said to reopen slaughterhouses,” Brown added, asking,  “How many workers should give their lives their lives to increase our GDP or the Dow Jones by a thousand points?”

“No workers should give their lives to do that, Mr. Senator, and I think your characterization is unfair,” Mnuchin shot back, explaining that the administration had provided guidelines and equipment.

“Secretary, I’m not going to let you make a political speech about ‘what a great job,’ we hear from the president and his news conferences, but the president has still not lead an effort to scale up testing, he played state after state, state against state and he played hospital against hospital and everyone in the country, your comments notwithstanding, knows that.”


Brown then pivoted to speak with Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell, refusing to give Mnuchin a chance to respond.",Daily Caller
Border Patrol Arrests Illegal Migrant Who Tested Positive For Coronavirus,2020/04/28,https://dailycaller.com/2020/04/28/border-patrol-illegal-alien-coronavirus/,"An Indian national apprehended by a Border Patrol agent on Thursday was soon discovered to be the first individual in Customs and Border Protection (CBP) custody to carry the novel coronavirus.

A Border Patrol agent apprehended four migrants — three Mexican nationals and one Indian national — attempting to enter the United States illegally on Thursday along the U.S-Mexico border near Calexico, California, according to a press release from the agency. The three Mexican nationals were quickly returned across the border, while the Indian national was taken into a Border Patrol facility for processing.

The unidentified Indian man, a 31-year-old, was evaluated by medical professionals and placed into quarantine after displaying “flu like symptoms.” The man ultimately tested positive for COVID-19, making him the first known detainee in CBP custody to have the disease.

CBP acting Commissioner Mark Morgan responded to the incident, and spoke about the risks CBP agents face every day during the coronavirus outbreak.

“The potential for the introduction and spread of COVID-19 in CBP stations and processing centers presents a danger to migrants, our frontline agents and officers, and the American people,” Morgan said. “Our agents and officers continue to protect our country from this invisible enemy, risking their own lives for the health of our nation.”

He added: “This is precisely the reason the CDC has given CBP the authority to rapidly return individuals that could potentially be infected with COVID-19.”


CBP said it’s undergoing “contact tracing” of anyone who might have interacted with the individual, and his symptoms are being closely monitored. He has been moved to an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility and will continue to be treated.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), upon orders from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, first declared a ban on many forms of travel along the country’s northern and southern borders March 20. That order was extended for another 30 days on April 20.

Not only is movement though the northern and southern borders restricted to “essential” traffic, but the government has also green-lighted the immediate removal of illegal aliens. Under Title 42, illegal aliens are immediately returned, when conditions allow for such quick returns — this is how the three Mexican nationals on Thursday were quickly sent back.

Since the border closure has been put in place, illegal alien crossings along the U.S.-Mexico border have plummeted. The apprehension numbers are a far cry from the middle of 2019, when the border was overwhelmed by an immigration crisis. (RELATED: The White House Just Released The Immigration Ban. Here’s What’s Inside)


Morgan noted how far worse the coronavirus pandemic would be at the U.S.-Mexico border if the Trump administration had never gotten the crisis under control.

“Can you imagine if we were navigating this pandemic during this time last year, when we had more than 20,000 migrants in our custody?” he asked in a Monday statement. “It would have overwhelmed our processing centers and stations, and crippled the healthcare system along the border.”",Daily Caller
Denmark Ends Lockdown After Partial Reopening Doesn’t See Rise In Cases,2020/05/18,https://dailycaller.com/2020/05/18/denmark-ends-lockdown-reopening-no-rise-cases/,"Denmark ended its national lockdown Monday after a partial reopening of the country’s economy did not lead to a rise in coronavirus cases.

Last month, Denmark became the first country in Europe to enact a partial reopening, and since then the number of new cases and the rate of transmission has been dropping, Reuters reported. With a population of nearly 6 million people, Denmark has confirmed almost 11,000 cases and 548 deaths so far, according to the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center.


Danish authorities reported no deaths Friday, the first time since March 13, and the country’s health experts say that a second wave of the coronavirus is unlikely to affect the country.

The second phase of reopening began May 11, with shopping malls and restaurants becoming accessible to the public once again. (RELATED: 4.5 Million People Return To Work As Italy Eases Lockdown Restrictions)

Denmark, like other countries in Europe, enacted partial reopening policies in April in order to ensure that new outbreaks would be prevented. Poland began to open public places in April, and Austria did the same, with neither country reporting an increase in new cases or deaths. Ireland also began its first phase of reopening Friday.

Denmark did not rely on mass testing and contact tracing, nor did it recommend face masks and other coverings. Some health experts, like Danish professor Hans Jorn Kolmos, attributed the country’s success to citizen behavior.


“The quick shutdown and the fact that Danes actually listened to messages from authorities about good hygiene and social distancing are the main reasons we’ve come this far,” he said.",Daily Caller

The virus claimed nearly 22,000 lives in the city, a death toll larger than all but 6 countries, according to CNN.

Hair salons, offices and indoor seating at bars and restaurant are not expected to reopen until the next phase.

Democratic New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo required the city to ramp up its local contact tracing program and coronavirus testing in order to reopen.

Although cases have declined in the city, Cuomo expressed concern over the likelihood that the protests over the death of George Floyd may cause a spike in cases.

Sunday marked the 11th day of protests in New York City, and De Blasio implemented a citywide curfew after a spree of looting and violent rioting.

"A Behind-The-Scenes Look At Pence’s Latest, Off-Camera Coronavirus Task Force Briefing",2020/05/05,https://dailycaller.com/2020/05/05/pence-white-house-coronavirus-birx/,"Vice President Mike Pence delivered a new presentation to the Daily Caller and other media outlets Tuesday on the latest strategies and data the White House task force is employing to combat COVID-19.

Pence first addressed his Monday call with all 50 governors, during which plans to reopen state economies and expand testing capacity were reviewed by Dr. Deborah Birx and other members of the task force.


“The American people should be very proud of what they accomplished over the past few months,” Pence told the room. “The sacrifices that families, businesses large and small made have slowed the spread of the virus.”

Birx added the U.S. will be emphasizing a sentinel surveillance strategy to get a better picture of where and how the disease is spreading in the U.S. She also told reporters that asymptomatic spread is much higher than previously understood, making workplace testing and the monitoring of nursing homes all the more necessary.

“We want to find an outbreak before it occurs,” Birx said. “That’s why you have to actually do sentinel surveillance, not just diagnosis and contact tracing of the people who present with symptoms, and so a lot of our data every day is is based on doing that.” (RELATED: Asked Whether China Censored Early Coronavirus Data, Senior WHO Official Said He ‘Didn’t Look’)

Sentinel surveillance is a more focused method of data collection in which only specific, highly-qualified labs and clinics are recruited to report on “specific health events that may be generalizable to the whole population.” One such health event, for example, would be determining the prevalence of asymptomatic spread.


The Vice President noted that as testing scales up, total infections will also surge. He clarified, however, that the overall positivity rate will decrease, as is happening in every major metropolitan area except Chicago. Pence also pointed to a decrease in new hospitalizations for coronavirus as a sign mitigation efforts are working. The first week of April saw 40,000 new coronavirus-based hospital visits compared to less than 25,000 during the month’s final week.

The the task force is also investigating ways to speed the development of a coronavirus vaccine. Trump said the initial timelines put forward by drug companies were “unacceptable,” according to HHS Secretary Alex Azar. As a result, the administration created Operation Warp Speed, a Manhattan Project-style program that will provide funding for and compress the timeline for private sector vaccine efforts.

“We don’t want to rely on a single vector, or a single technology,” Azar explained at the briefing. (RELATED: White House Bars Coronavirus Task Force Members From Testifying To Congress In May)

Trump’s goal for the program is to produce a million COVID-19 vaccine doses by fall 2020 and 300 million by January.


“That is a goal that would be unprecedented and historic to achieve that,” Azar said. “It is important to remember this, it would be unprecedented and historic to achieve this, in bio medical development, [it has] never happened before.”

Food and Drug Administration commissioner Dr. Stephen Hahn and Azar added that the compression efforts will see the administration accelerating approval for successful candidates based on preliminary efficacy data, so that mass production and later stage clinical trials take place at the same time. Both Azar and Hahn assured Daily Caller that the government has the facilities to potentially manufacture hundreds of millions of doses simultaneously to meet the president’s delivery goals, and that all safety measures would be followed in producing the vaccines.


Centers for Medicare & Medicaid administrator Seema Verna additionally announced at the meeting that in accordance with the White House’s reopening guidelines, CMS is taking extra steps to ensure the safety of nursing home residents. Not only will CMS ship personal protective equipment to 15,400 nursing homes across the country, but will also increase reimbursement for testing costs and coronavirus therapies in nursing homes.

Finally, Pence addressed reporting from New York Times suggesting the White House has plans to scale back the task force’s oversight in the coming weeks. Pence confirmed that discussions on a Memorial Day window for winding down the team are taking place but stressed they are all preliminary and that nothing has yet been finalized. He added that Dr. Birx would likely remain in her role as task force response coordinator even if the task force is disbanded.

Pritzker spoke with CNN’s Jake Tapper about the next steps for the state of Illinois and when people could expect things to go back to normal. (RELATED: Illinois Governor Still Blaming Trump For GOP Governors Slow To Enact Stay-At-Home Orders)


WATCH:



Pritzker began by explaining the ongoing efforts in Illinois to implement a dramatic increase in testing as well as contact tracing, saying that he had been largely going it alone.

“I have not been counting on the White House, because there have been too many situations in which they’ve made promises not delivered. Very recently they promised a lot of swabs. They’re supposed to arrive today, the first shipment of those. I’m looking forward to that,” he said.

But then Tapper turned the conversation to recent confusion over Pritzker’s plan to reopen, from warnings that students may still be engaging in distance learning in the fall to reports that churches would not be allowed to hold regular services until a vaccine was available.

“So there’s some confusion about what your goal is in terms of reopening. The Chicago Tribune Editorial Board published an editorial about your reopening plan, they write, quote, ‘he’s being more than just cautious, he’s moved the goalposts. Governor Pritzker’s stated goal was to get the outbreak under control, not eradicate Covid-19 completely. We don’t want his pursuit of the perfect outcome to unnecessarily delay the restarting of activities,'” Tapper read. “What’s your reaction to that, and what is your end goal for Illinois to go back to some semblance of normal?”

Pritzker responded by saying that the plan was already underway, noting that restaurants and bars in Illinois would likely remain closed for some time.

“Phase IV is just the phase before we would have a vaccine, assuming we maybe never get a vaccine, we’ll have to deal with hopefully a treatment that will come along that will be very effective, but even without that, everyone’s going to have to wear a mask,” he explained. “We’re still going to have to socially distance. The truth is that Coronavirus is still out there.”


“It hasn’t gone anywhere. And so we all are going to have to change the way we do things until we’re able to eradicate it. If the Chicago Tribune thinks everything will go back to complete normal without us having an effective treatment or a vaccine, they’re just dead wrong,” Pritzker concluded.",Daily Caller
Former Trump Official: Georgia Opening Up So Soon Increases ‘Risk Of Infection’,2020/04/26,https://dailycaller.com/2020/04/26/scott-gottlieb-georgia-open-coronavirus/,"Former FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb said Sunday that Georgia may be opening up too soon and consequently upping the risk of infection for the rest of the country.

“Face the Nation” host Margaret Brennan asked, “Parts of the country are opening up, Georgia is getting a lot of attention for how much they’ve opened up and so quickly. What does that do to the rest of the country? Does it up the risk of infection?”




Gottlieb replied that it “does up the risk of infection” and that Georgia is “certainly not out of the woods.”

He elaborated, saying, “They’re only testing about 1% of their total population. They have 23,000 cases. They may have plateaued in their epidemic, but they’re accruing new cases. And they’re not coming down in the terms of the number of cases. The slope up in terms of cases that got us to the point of this epidemic was a rapid slope, a rapid progression. The slope down is going to be far more gradual.”

He then compared America’s infection rate to China and Italy, saying that America’s coronavirus decline is more likely to look similar to Italy’s.


“In China, the slope down was symmetric with the slope up. In Italy, they rapidly grew the number of cases, and they’re very slowly coming down. We’re likely to look a lot more like Italy. It will take some time until we see sustained decline in cases and get to the point where there is a low enough spread in the country that we can feel comfortable about opening up parts of the country.”

Georgia, on Friday, began to relax their social distancing restrictions as Republican Gov. Brian Kemp allowed certain businesses to reopen.

Gottlieb has authored a detailed plan to reopen the country that involves extensive testing and comprehensive contact tracing. (RELATED: This Former Trump Official Has A Detailed Plan To Reopen The Economy And Get People Back To Work)",Daily Caller
