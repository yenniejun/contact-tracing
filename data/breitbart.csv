Poll: More Than 7 in 10 Americans Refuse to Use Contact Tracing Apps,2020/06/16,https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2020/06/16/poll-more-than-7-in-10-americans-refuse-to-use-contact-tracing-apps/,"According to a recent report, more than seven in ten Americans refuse to use coronavirus contact tracing apps developed by tech giants like Apple and Google.

Ars Technica reports that according to data gathered from an online survey of over 2,000 people in the United States conducted by polling firm Opinion Matters on behalf of the security firm Avira, 71 percent of Americans state that they will not be downloading a coronavirus contact tracing app, including those based on joint tech developed by Apple and Google.


According to the data, fewer than 3 in 10 Americans intend to use contact tracing apps developed to track the spread of the Wuhan coronavirus. In April, It was reported that one in two Americans would probably or definitely not use a contact tracing app, showing a growing distrust for the tracking tools.

Most of those that refused to use a contact tracing app were over the age of 55. Those who responded that they would not be using an app were asked to explain the decision with a multiple-choice poll. The most common reason people were hesitant to use a contact tracing app was privacy.

44 percent of those who said “no” to a contact-tracing app said that they would not trust the tech to protect their digital privacy. 39 percent believe that the apps created a false sense of security, while 37 percent believe the apps would not work to slow the spread of the virus. 35 percent also indicated a distrust of app makers.

Just two months ago, 57 percent of people surveyed said that they’d trust public health agencies, 47 percent said they would trust insurance companies, and 43 percent said they’d trust Silicon Valley tech firms. Now, only 32 percent say they’d trust Google or Apple, and only 14 percent stated that they’d trust the government to keep their data private.

States Back Out of Google and Apple’s Contact Tracing App Plans,2020/06/15,https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2020/06/15/states-back-out-of-google-and-apples-contact-tracing-app-plans/,"Multiple States across the country are reportedly walking back promises to use contact tracing systems developed by Silicon Valley tech firms such as Google and Apple.

NBC News reports that this week New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy outlined his plans to trace the spread of the coronavirus by hiring 1,600 contact tracers to call people who may have been exposed to the coronavirus. Murphy did not plan to use any form of smartphone app to help with contact tracing, stating when asked: “The state of New Jersey is neither pursuing nor promoting exposure notification or digital alerting technology, at least at this time.”


 

Multiple states that had committed to using contract tracing apps or expressed interest in them are now rolling back their statements. California Governor Gavin Newsom (D) initially vocally supported the use of contact tracing apps, stating that he wanted to “build that capacity and partnership” with Apple and Google after they announced their contact tracing system. Two months later, no contact tracing apps or cellphone tracking technology are being used in California according to a spokesperson for California’s Public Health Department.

The spokesperson told NBC News: “Most of the contact tracing work (notifying people who have been in close contact with an infected person to prevent the disease from spreading to others) can be done by phone, text, email and chat.”

A recent survey by Business Insider this week should that only three states, Alabaman, North Dakota, and South Carolina, are going to use Apple and Google’s tracing system. So far, none have launched an app with the Google and Apple system. Andy Slavitt, an Obama administration health care official who is chair of the nonprofit United States of Care, commented: “The factual analytical assessment is it’s not a high upside. The bulk of the investment you need to make is in manpower.”

Schools Worried About Coronavirus Are Turning into Surveillance States,2020/06/08,https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2020/06/08/schools-worried-about-coronavirus-are-turning-into-surveillance-states/,"As students across the United States begin to return to school, some schools are requiring students to wear tracking beacons to prevent the spread of the Chinese virus.

Wired reports that as students across the United States begin to return to school following months of lockdown to the Wuhan coronavirus pandemic, many schools are taking measures to prevent the spread of the virus including implementing tracking beacons that students must wear to ensure they are not gathering in large groups.


Wired reports that the school district of New Albany, Ohio, with five schools and 4,800 students plans to test a system requiring each student to wear an electronic tracking beacon that will record their location accurately to within a few feet throughout the day. It will record where students sit in each classroom, show who they interact with, and reveal how they gather in groups. The aim of this technology is to prevent or minimize another coronavirus outbreak.

Many schools are planning to reopen on a gradual basis while keeping students as spread out as possible. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s guidelines for reopening schools recommend staggered daily schedules that allow for smaller class sizes, open windows to provide air circulation, avoiding sharing books and computers, regular cleaning of all buses and classrooms, and the requirement of masks and handwashing.

Michael Sawyers, superintendent for New Albany-Plain Schools commented: “We are very much interested in the automated tracking of students.” Sawyers believes that tracking technology could help the school to determine whether social distancing is being observed correctly and identify students who may have tested positive for the virus.

Industry experts have noticed that a small but growing surveillance industry has appeared following the coronavirus pandemic with many firms pitching temperature-tracking infrared cameras, wireless beacons, and contact tracing apps to enforce social distancing. Albert Fox Cahn, founder of the Surveillance Technology Oversight Project, commented: “It’s been one of the most disturbing parts of this.”

Cahn believes that the industry is keen to find a way into classrooms. “One of the things that will be a huge profit driver, potentially, is that younger children would need specially designed devices if they don’t have smartphones,” he said.

Minnesota Using ‘Contact Tracing’ to Determine if Agitators ‘Organized Cell of Terror’,2020/05/30,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/05/30/minnesota-using-contact-tracing-to-determine-if-agitators-organized-cell-of-terror/,"Minnesota Department of Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington told reporters on Saturday that his agency is using “contact tracing” to identify the associations of rioters arrested in the state on Friday.




“We have begun analyzing the data of who we’ve arrested, and begun actually doing what you would think as, almost very similar to our COVID. It’s contact tracing,” Harrington said.

“Who are they associated with? What platforms are they advocating for? And we’ve seen things like white supremacist organizers who have posted things on platforms about coming to Minnesota,” he said.


 
“We’re checking to see if people that we have made arrests on and that we have information, are they connected to those platforms. We’ve seen flyers about protests where folks have talked about they’re ‘going to get their loot on tonight,'” Harrington said.

He said Minnesota authorities are looking into whether the individuals are “part of an organized criminal organization, and if so, what is that organization and how are they organized,” he said.

Harrington said all levels of government are analyzing whether it is “organized crime.”

“Is this an organized cell of terror?” he said.

Gov. Tim Walz said they were talking about it to get “the media” to do additional investigations on the individuals and their connections to organizations.",Breitbart
Exclusive – Canceled Contact Tracing Contract Reveals Michigan Authorized Democrat Firm for 400 Activists to Collect Medical Information,2020/05/27,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/05/27/exclusive-canceled-contact-tracing-contract-reveals-michigan-authorized-democrat-firm-for-400-activists-to-collect-medical-information/,"A copy of the since-canceled contact tracing contract Michigan Democrat Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s administration executed with a Democrat operative’s consulting firm, obtained exclusively by Breitbart News, shows the firm would have been paid to recruit 400 volunteers to collect medical information from state residents.

The contract was signed April 20, 2020, between the Michigan Public Health Institute and Great Lakes Community Engagement, a nonprofit organization under the control of Mike Kolehouse, a Democrat campaign consultant.


 

Great Lakes Community Engagement – Subcontract by Breitbart News on Scribd



Emails released on Tuesday show Whitmer’s team gave the “green light” to hire the firm, according to Bridge Magazine.

“We got the green light from EOG [the executive office of the governor] to move forward with a slightly different organizational arrangement of the contact tracing volunteer work,” Andrea Taverna, a senior adviser at the Department of Health and Human Services, said in an email to other health department officials.


 
“This would still be working with Mike Kolehouse, so work there isn’t lost — it’s just organized somewhat differently,” she wrote.

Despite those statements, Whitmer’s office has sought to distance her from the arrangement.

“When it was brought to my attention, I told them to cancel it,” Whitmer said during an April 22 press conference.

She also defended the department, saying it “does not have a political bone in their theoretical body.”

But no one has explained how Kolehouse, who has a long history of working exclusively for Democrat campaigns and progressive causes, came onto the scene to begin with.

Janice Kidd, finance and budget manager at the Michigan Public Health Institute, signed the agreement.


Kidd has not responded to Breitbart News about who authorized her to sign the document.

The contract laid out personnel and a payment schedule.

“The staff overseeing these programs will consist of the Owner/Operator, Director of Operations, and a 16-person management team. The management team includes two Project Managers and 14 Volunteer Managers who will each oversee approximately 400 volunteers,” it read.

Initial Payment: The first 4 weeks of services of $64,500, plus the cost of an estimated 50 shifts ($17,500), for a total invoice amount of $82,000. Once invoiced, the first payment will be due on May 1st.

Final Payment: The last 4 weeks of service will be based on shifts used in the previous month, subcontractor will adjust the bill accordingly. The invoice will include $86,000 for 4 weeks of management, plus the cost of an estimated 75 shifts ($26,250) for a total of $112,250. Once invoiced, the second payment will be due on June 1st.

Total payments from MPHI to the Subcontractor under this Agreement, shall not exceed the sum of ONE HUNDRED NINETY-FOUR THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY and 00/100 DOLLARS ($194,250.00). MPHI shall make payments to Subcontractor within forty-five (45) days after receipt by the Business Office of an invoice that has been approved by the project coordinator indicating the amount due and the subcontract reference number.

The contract also included a two-and-a-half page exhibit detailing privacy requirements due to the sensitivity of the medical information volunteers would be obtaining.


 
The agreement also included a “Stop Work Order” provision, which was invoked the following day after media scrutiny in a letter to Kolehouse:

The Michigan Department of Health & Human Services (MDHHS) has requested that the Michigan Public Health Institute (MPHI) issue a Stop Work Order to Great Lakes Community Engagement for work on project N-80007. Consequently, per Section 19 of your agreement, this letter serves as your Stop Work Order notification. All work must stop immediately on this project, effective April 21, 2020.

Apple and Google Release Chinese Virus Contact Tracing Tech,2020/05/21,https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2020/05/21/apple-and-google-release-chinese-virus-contact-tracing-tech/,"Tech giants Apple and Google have reportedly released the technology to automatically notify people if they have been exposed to individuals that have tested positive for the Wuhan coronavirus. The technology was produced by the two tech giants to allow iPhones and Android smartphones to communicate.

AP News reports that tech giants Apple and Google released smartphone technology on Wednesday to notify users that they may have been in contact with individuals who have been exposed to the Wuhan coronavirus. 22 countries and several states in the United States are planning to build voluntary phone apps using their software.


The contact tracing system relies on Bluetooth wireless technology to detect when someone who downloaded the app has spent time near another app user who has tested positive for the virus.

Multiple governments have attempted to roll out their own phone apps since the beginning of the Wuhan coronavirus pandemic. Many of the apps have faced technical issues and have failed to be widely adopted, they also often use GPS track user’s price locations which Apple and Google have banned from their new tools for privacy and security reasons.

Health agencies in Germany as well as in the U.S. states of Alabama and South Carolina have been waiting to use Apple and Google’s new system while other governments claim that the tech giant’s privacy restrictions make the system harder for public health workers to use.

The tech firms claim that app users will be protected by encryption and anonymous identifier beacons that regularly change. The companies said in a joint statement: “User adoption is key to success and we believe that these strong privacy protections are also the best way to encourage use of these apps.”

The statement from the firms also included comments from state officials in North Dakota, Alabama and South Carolina which appear to signal plans to use the new tech. North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, a Republican, commented: “We invite other states to join us in leveraging smartphone technologies to strengthen existing contact tracing efforts, which are critical to getting communities and economies back up and running.”

Breitbart News reported in April that privacy experts are warning that this tracing tech could be an invasion of user privacy.  Klon Kitchen, a technology analyst at the Heritage Foundation, told MarketWatch: “All of this could be abused. But information that could be used is already being collected.” But he added, “They have a vested interest in getting the economy up and running, and getting their engineers back in the building, and the government lacks the ability to do this.”

Josephine Wolff, a cybersecurity policy professor at The Fletcher School at Tufts University, commented on the tech stating: “The bigger concern is: What if other entities can access?” But Wolff seems reassured that the firms will keep any identifiable information out o the hands of third parties due to the 15 minute refresh time on the identifier on Apple and Google devices. “You might worry about someone creating a map of where you have been, but with an identifier that changes every 15 minutes it would be so much harder to trace to an individual person,” said Wolff.

Wolff added: “The truth about Google and Apple is they have so much information about us already.” Even New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat who has praised Apple and Google’s efforts, noted that there are privacy concerns relating to the tech. “Apple and other companies are working on using technology to do tracking. How do we do that and how do we do it fast?” Cuomo said before acknowledging the privacy issue stating: “Do you really want that cell phone in your pocket to be a tracking device?”

A survey at the end of April found that three out of five Americans are unwilling or unable to use the smartphone contact tracing technology developed by the Masters of the Universe in Silicon Valley.",Breitbart

Contract tracing involves monitoring and tracing the contacts of individuals who have been infected by the novel coronavirus — a method many critics view as a slippery slope and an assault on privacy.

The British government has already embraced the concept, introducing a contract tracing app, which stores user data on government servers.

As Breitbart News reported:

The app was developed by NHSX (the digital arm of the country’s socialised medical system) alongside the GCHQ intelligence agency. The app will store user data on centralised government servers rather than taking the decentralised approach advocated by Apple and Google, which are also developing a contact tracing app for other countries. Other nations in Europe including Germany, Switzerland, Estonia, Austria, and the Republic of Ireland have all opted for a decentralised system of contact tracing, in which data is stored locally on a user’s device, not sent to a central or government server.

House Democrats, meanwhile, are promoting the COVID-19 Testing, Reaching, And Contacting Everyone Act (TRACE Act), or  H.R. 6666, which authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services to “award grants to eligible entities to conduct diagnostic testing for COVID–19, and related activities such as contact tracing, through mobile health units and, as necessary, at individuals’ residences.”

Per the proposal, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) would issue $100 billion in grants to entities — including federally qualified health centers, school-based health clinics, academic medical centers, and non-profits — to conduct extensive contact tracing, which could lead workers straight to an individual’s doorstep.

“Until we have a vaccine to defeat this dreaded disease, contact tracing in order to understand the full breadth and depth of the spread of this virus is the only way we will be able to get out from under this,” Rep. Bobby L. Rush (D-IL), who introduced the measure, said.

He added:

The COVID-19 TRACE Act will allow us to do this by creating a $100 billion dollar grant program for local organizations to hire, train, and pay individuals and to purchase supplies to run mobile testing units and door-to-door outreach as is safe and necessary, with special preference being given to those operating in hot spots and medically underserved communities, as well as those entities who commit to hiring from these neighborhoods.

“This is nothing but a massive government surveillance program cloaked in a cure-the-coronavirus label,” the Washington Times’ Cheryl K. Chumley said of the proposal.


 
Rush has rejected the strong opposition of critics, claiming that there is “nothing in this bill that will threaten anyone’s individual liberties”:

"China: Federalism, Lack of ‘National Tracking’ Mean U.S. Cannot Defeat Coronavirus",2020/05/14,https://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2020/05/14/china-federalism-lack-of-national-tracking-mean-u-s-cannot-defeat-coronavirus/,"Chinese state media on Wednesday asserted that federalism, multi-party democracy, and respect for individual privacy would make it impossible for the United States to defeat the Wuhan coronavirus, since Washington cannot dictate top-down solutions for the entire country or micro-monitor American citizens the way Beijing does.

The Global Times made the usual effort to stir up partisan divisions and blame the U.S. for trying to “pass the buck to China” instead of agreeing to forget where the coronavirus came from before getting to the meat of its argument, which was that Americans are paying a steep price for not being obedient drones governed by an absolute central authority:


 

The epidemic fight must be a people’s war, but the Americans have not been fully mobilized to fight the coronavirus with science. It has taken a long and bumpy road for Americans to wear masks despite being such a simple thing. Only very recently were White House staffers ordered to wear masks. However, Washington’s attempt to politically mobilize the society hasn’t stopped for a moment. It’s working every minute to make supporting forced resumption of work a political correctness. The US government keeps telling its people not to be afraid of the epidemic, to go back to work and smear China.

How can such a US defeat the virus? The number of deaths in the country has exceeded 82,000, and will soon surpass the iconic mark of 100,000. But the US hasn’t formed a unified fight against the epidemic within the country, nor is there a consistent strategy. The last round of social distancing measures only alleviated the epidemic. The US rushed to resume work and production without establishing a strong capability to track the infected.

Constrained by the federal system, the US is weak in coordinating actions nationwide. The deformed party politics has further hindered the formation of a united epidemic fight. The US epidemic response has failed to match its scientific strength and superior public health conditions. It is fighting a chaotic battle, costing a lot while gaining little and ordinary people have become the biggest victims. Unfortunately, the most prevalent thing within the US now is to shirk responsibility and pass the buck to China.

The world’s sole superpower is degenerating. The only way to “Make America Great Again” is to rebuild the spirit of science, which should start with subduing the novel coronavirus with science itself. What will defeat the virus is scientific prevention and control. The virus knows no borders; it will launch fatal attacks against countries with weaker defenses.

China’s “blame the victim” efforts to shame other countries out of complaining about the virus China sent them is not much of a charm offensive, but it does give Chinese Communist Party (CCP) propaganda writers an easy script to stick to. 

As for the worship of holy science as the antidote to political dissent, it demonstrates once again that the CCP is a keen student of American left-wing rhetoric and mainstream media coverage. Of course, it would never occur to a Communist that the reason American medicine is so vastly superior to their own — to the point where they had to steal every technological innovation of the past three decades through massive hacking and intellectual property theft campaigns — is precisely because the spirit of dissent, the urge to challenge consensus and unsettle dogmatic conclusions, nourishes scientific progress. As too many people in the Western world forget, science is about questions and technology is about answers.

Contract tracing to contain the pandemic is not impossible under a federalist system with respect for individual dignity. NPR reported last week that 44 states and the District of Columbia have concrete plans to expand their contract tracing task forces, with over 66,000 workers expected to be on the job when the plans are fully implemented. 


 
Some of those states noted their contact tracing workforces could be considerably larger because county health departments can only estimate their staffing levels and some have medical staffers who work on tracing in addition to their primary duties. Additionally, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has deployed 500 staffers to help with state and local tracing programs and is planning to send out another 650. Plans have been discussed to create a massive federal contract tracing agency to supplement and coordinate state efforts.",Breitbart

The original measure was due to expire on Friday. Bowser also said she prolonged D.C.’s lockdown because the District has not yet seen a transmission rate under one for three days.

Transmission rate refers to how many new infections come from each coronavirus case.

Bowser’s decision to extend the lockdown in D.C. came as the number of daily new coronavirus cases has begun to drop along with community spread and the rate of transmission, the District’s own data show.

Some projections have also predicted that although testing numbers will continue to improve in the next few weeks, the number of estimated infections (including unconfirmed mild and asymptomatic cases) will go down along with daily deaths and the use of hospital beds.

“As of Wednesday, the District is in a four-day decrease in community spread. In addition, the rate of transmission has been below one for two days, according to Bowser,” the Patch noted.

D.C.’s goal is for the transmission rate to be below one for three days. It is also aiming for a 14-day decrease in the community spread.

Referring to contact tracing issues in the capital, the Patch added:

The District’s goal is to be able to contact trace any new case within one day and their close contacts within two days. Currently, D.C. Health can contact trace for its priority populations — essential workers, at-risk healthcare personnel, etc. — and their close contacts, so it still needs to build out its testing capacity in order to handle the surge of new cases.

“This is the piece that will help us ensure that we won’t have widespread community transmissions when we see those new infections,” Bowser proclaimed, referring to contact tracing.


The mayor also acknowledged that the District is already able to test areas essential to a phased reopening, including symptomatic individuals, at-risk healthcare personnel, essential workers, and close contacts of new cases.

Nevertheless, she added:

We still, however, don’t think we’re testing all of the people who need to be tested in those four groups. We continue to reach out to people, making everybody aware of the testing locations and that those tests are free and that we’ll continue to do that.

On Tuesday, Adm. Brett Giroir, the assistant secretary for health at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), told a Senate panel that the Trump administration would be able to meet all U.S. testing needs for May and June.


 
D.C. also has more than enough beds to treat the current number of coronavirus cases, the District’s data show.

It also appears to have an adequate number of beds to deal with an expected surge of cases with a phased reopening.

“We have been very confident about the number of beds at area hospitals that are part of our surge capacity,” Bowser declared.

“Without a surge, the District needs to have its healthcare capacity at less than 80 percent over seven days. The District’s current healthcare occupancy is at 76 percent and it has been under 80 percent for 14 days,” the Patch noted.

The cumulative number of cases and deaths in D.C. do continue to rise.

D.C. marked its highest single-day number of coronavirus cases on May 1 (335 cases) and its second-highest on May 8 (245), but the figures have steadily dropped since.

The District’s number of deaths per one million residents, at 476, is also higher than the national average of 252 per one million people, Worldometer reported.

Furthermore, the number of cases per one million residents in D.C., at 9,189, is more than double the national average of 4,256 cases per one million people.

The positive rate (over 20 percent) of the total number of tests that health officials have administered in D.C. is also higher than the national average of about 14 percent, according to the COVID Tracking Project.

However, more people are testing negative (24,565) than positive (6,485) in the nation’s capital.

To begin reopening, D.C. needs “fourteen days of consistent downward trend in coronavirus cases, hospitalizations and/or the percentage of tests that come back positive,” the local CBS-affiliated TV station WUSA9 reported.

“It’s the same criteria included in the White House’s ‘Opening Up America Again’ plan,” it added. “It’s based in part on the coronavirus’ up-to-14-day incubation period.”


 
Based on the criteria highlighted in the White House guidelines, the nation’s capital is not yet ready to reopen, particularly given the absence of a 14-day downward trend in cases.

As of Wednesday, coronavirus had infected 6,584 people and killed 350, according to data from the capital’s health department.",Breitbart
"Democrats Push ‘Devil’ Coronavirus Bill H.R. 6666, ‘Door-to-Door’ Contract Tracing",2020/05/12,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/05/12/democrats-push-devil-coronavirus-bill-h-r-6666-door-to-door-contract-tracing/,"House Democrats are proposing H.R. 6666, a multi-billion dollar bill authorizing the Secretary of Health and Human Services to “award grants to eligible entities to conduct diagnostic testing for COVID–19, and related activities such as contact tracing, through mobile health units and, as necessary, at individuals’ residences.”

The COVID-19 Testing, Reaching, And Contacting Everyone (TRACE) Act — what some appropriately note is filed as H.R. 6666 — provides $100 billion in grants distributed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to “eligible entities” so they can “trace and monitor the contacts of infected individuals, and to support the quarantine of such contacts, through mobile health units and, as necessary, testing individuals and providing individuals with services related to testing and quarantine at their residences.”


According to the legislation, recipients of the grant can use the funds to “hire, train, compensate, and pay the expenses” of individuals to carry out the tasks related to testing and contact tracing.

Eligible entities include federally qualified health centers, school-based health clinics, academic medical centers, non-profits, institutions of higher education, and any other entity that the secretary deems eligible.

Rep. Bobby L. Rush (D-IL) formally introduced the bill this month, asserting that it will be “impossible” to reopen the economy and return to normal “if we do not step up our testing efforts and implement robust and widespread contact tracing.”

“Until we have a vaccine to defeat this dreaded disease, contact tracing in order to understand the full breadth and depth of the spread of this virus is the only way we will be able to get out from under this,” he said of the TRACE Act, attempting soften certain aspects of the bill by using the phrase “door-to-door outreach.”

Rush said:

The COVID-19 TRACE Act will allow us to do this by creating a $100 billion dollar grant program for local organizations to hire, train, and pay individuals and to purchase supplies to run mobile testing units and door-to-door outreach as is safe and necessary, with special preference being given to those operating in hot spots and medically underserved communities, as well as those entities who commit to hiring from these neighborhoods.

“I am immensely proud to see this bill receive bipartisan support and I hope to see the COVID-19 TRACE Act swiftly adopted by the House as a stand-alone bill or as part of a larger coronavirus response package,” he added:

The Illinois Democrat said in the Q&A portion of his release that taking the tests “would be completely voluntary.” He also attempted to tamp down concerns of government overreach by stating in bold font that the bill “does not authorize anyone to enter your home, for whatever reason, without your permission, nor does it allow the government to remove anyone from your home because of the coronavirus.”

On Tuesday, Rush continued, contending that there is “nothing in this bill that will threaten anyone’s individual liberties”:

However, his proclamation has done little to ease the concerns of critics, who view the bill as a slippery slope.

“This is nothing but a massive government surveillance program cloaked in a cure-the-coronavirus label,” the Washington Times’ Cheryl K. Chumley warned, adding that the measure “does it deceptively so, under the guise of providing a societal good.”

H.R. 6666 has several co-sponsors, mostly Democrats, including Reps. Ro Khanna (D-CA), Rashida Tlaib (D-MI), Tim Ryan (D-OH), Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI), Frederica Wilson (D-FL), and Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-FL).",Breitbart
Menendez: Can’t ‘Jump-Start’ Economy Without National Testing Strategy and ‘Comprehensive Contact Tracing’,2020/05/09,https://www.breitbart.com/clips/2020/05/09/menendez-cant-jump-start-economy-without-national-testing-strategy-and-comprehensive-contact-tracing/,"During Friday’s Democratic weekly address, Sen. Bob Menendez (D-NJ) stated that without “comprehensive contact tracing” and a national testing strategy that ensures everyone who needs a test can get one, “consumers won’t have the confidence needed to jump-start our economy.”

Transcript as Follows:

“Hi, I’m Bob Menendez, senior Senator for the state of New Jersey.

As I’m recording this message from my Senate office in Washington, countless medical and healthcare professionals across the country are on the frontlines, leading our fight against the coronavirus. Already this virus has taken more than 70,000 of our friends and loved ones, hundreds of thousands more remain sick as we pray for their recovery.

Grocery store clerks, warehouse and transit workers, and others are putting their own health at risk to keep food and supply chains going, and making sure essential employees can keep working. Tens of millions of people are out of work and families remain sequestered in their homes.

When Leader McConnell called the Senate back into session this week, I’d hope it was so we could immediately get started on an additional package in response to this unprecedented public health and economic crisis.

Instead, the week ends as it began.

Our country is still hurting. Our people are still suffering. And Senate Republicans are blocking action on critical coronavirus legislation. Each day they refuse to act sets us further behind.

Like you, I yearn for the day when all this is past us and we can finally return things to normal, or a ‘new normal.’ But we must have a national strategy for widespread testing so that everyone who needs a test can get a test, as President Trump promised over 2 months ago, as well as comprehensive contact tracing. Until then, consumers won’t have the confidence needed to jump-start our economy.

It’s never been clearer that our nation’s wealth depends on our nation’s health. No matter how quickly we want to rejoin society, reopen our economy, and return to normal, the reality is, folks just aren’t going to venture out until they know for sure that they are COVID-free and anyone else they come in contact with is okay as well.

Meanwhile, as we speak, our states, cities and towns are hemorrhaging money trying to defeat COVID-19 while revenues dry up. Talking this week with mayors in my home state of New Jersey, which has been ravaged by the coronavirus, they are running out of money to pay firefighters and police officers, teachers, and sanitation workers. Building permits aren’t being processed. Lifeguards aren’t being hired to patrol the beaches, or part-time staff to run summer camps.

This isn’t a blue state or red state issue, this is an American issue. If we ever want to get back to normal, to see businesses thrive, we need to ensure that our police officers and firefighters have the resources they need, we need to keep the lights on at city hall, our public workers on the job, our kids in school, our streets safe, the trash picked up, and the buses and trains running on time.

Contrary to Senator McConnell’s solution, we cannot bankrupt our way out of this crisis. That’s foolish and downright dangerous. Congress must pass, without delay, a robust state and local aid package that delivers the flexible funding our frontline states and communities need.

Congress must also ensure that the trillions of dollars it has already authorized to defeat the coronavirus are being spent properly by the Trump administration. That small mom and pops aren’t being shut out of help in favor of big Fortune 500 companies. That unemployment and stimulus checks are being paid. That hospitals, community health centers and nursing homes have the resources they need. That the American people are getting what they paid for.

They are counting on us.

Democrats are eager to do the people’s business. It’s time for Republicans to join us and get to work.

Thanks for listening, and stay healthy.”",Breitbart
Illinois Governor: No Religious Services for More than 50 Until Vaccine or Treatment ‘Widely Available’,2020/05/09,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/05/09/illinois-governor-no-religious-services-more-50-vaccine-treatment-widely-available/,"Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s plan to reopen his state calls for bans of gatherings of more than 50 people, including worship services, until a vaccine or treatment for the coronavirus is “widely available.”

The Democrat governor released his five-phase plan, titled “Restoring Illinois,” Tuesday, which says even at Phase 4, called “Revitalization,” “50 or fewer” would be permitted at any gatherings as long as testing and tracing are widely conducted.


 

The state is currently in Phase 2, or “Flattening” the curve, as the rate of infection is slowing.

According to the most recent data, Illinois is the fourth most affected state in the nation, with 73,760 total cases of COVID-19 and 3,241 deaths.

As of May 1, nursing home deaths accounted for 44 percent of Illinois fatalities due to the coronavirus.

“We have to figure out how to live with COVID-19 until it can be vanquished – and to do so in a way that best supports our residents’ health and our healthcare systems, and saves the most lives,” Pritzker said, reported NBC5 Chicago:

According to the plan, it is not until Phase 5, or “Illinois Restored,” when “testing, tracing and treatment are widely available throughout the state,” and “either a vaccine is developed to prevent additional spread of COVID-19, a treatment option is readily available that ensures health care capacity is no longer a concern, or there are no new cases over a sustained period,” will gatherings, including religious services, of more than 50 people, be permitted.

On Friday, Romanian churches in Illinois filed a federal lawsuit against Pritzker, claiming his executive orders discriminate against churches by restricting worship services to ten people while other commercial entities, such as liquor and “big box” stores are permitted to accommodate larger groups.

Liberty Counsel is representing Elim Romanian Pentecostal Church and Logos Baptist Ministries in the lawsuit. The nonprofit Christian firm stated in a press release:

Governor Pritzker has made it clear that churches will not be able to hold in-person gatherings of more than 10 people until Phase 4 of his Restore Illinois Plan, and that gatherings of more than 50 cannot take place until Phase 5, which he has stated may take more than one year to achieve, and will only be available if there is some vaccine widely available.

“Governor Pritzker has clearly discriminated against churches by limiting in-person services to only ten people while allowing other commercial and secular businesses to operate with large gatherings of people,” said Liberty Counsel chairman Mat Staver, adding:


 
In addition, the governor states it may be more than a year until this limit on churches can be lifted. This is unconstitutional as churches have the First Amendment right to exist, but businesses do not. In the land of the free, these Romanian pastors and church members should never have to fear arrest or sanction for attending worship services in church.

As Catholic News Agency reported, on May 1, the Archdiocese of Chicago announced public Masses with ten or fewer people could resume. Illinois, however, had previously banned not only all religious services, but also “drive-in” services, including drive-in confessions.

Pritzker’s plan says the state’s response to the coronavirus crisis “has been guided by data, science, and public health experts.”

The plan comes as Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said Wednesday the coronavirus lockdowns have been effective.

Fauci cautioned against lessening social distancing practices and added state and local governments should look to the White House task force’s guidelines to make decisions for reopening. Fauci and other public health officials have also said a vaccine for the coronavirus infection is at least 12 to 18 months from being developed and tested sufficiently to be made widely available.

Pritzker’s reopening plan echoes these statements.

“The risk of spread remains, and modeling and data point to a rapid surge in new cases if all mitigation measures were to be immediately lifted,” it states, adding the “path forward is not what everyone wants or hopes for, but it will keep Illinoisans as safe as possible from this virus as our economy is reopening.”",Breitbart
Surveillance State: UK Govt Rolls out Coronavirus Contact Tracing App,2020/05/06,https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2020/05/06/surveillance-state-uk-govt-rolls-out-coronavirus-contact-tracing-app/,"British citizens will be told that to accelerate the end of the lockdown, millions will need to download a contact tracing app which has raised concerns about privacy and a massive potential expansion of government surveillance.

The experimental app was made available to National Health Service (NHS) workers on the Isle of Wight on Monday and will begin testing on the 140,000 residents of the island on Thursday. The software will be released to the general public later this month alongside a massive government campaign that will urge citizens to download the app.


Health Secretary Matt Hancock said that the app would contain “high privacy” functions and urged the citizens of the Isle of Wight to download the app “to protect the NHS and save lives”.

“I know that the people of the Isle of Wight will embrace this with enthusiasm because by embarking on this project and embracing test, track and trace, you will be saving lives,” Hancock said in comments reported by The Times.

The app was developed by NHSX (the digital arm of the country’s socialised medical system) alongside the GCHQ intelligence agency. The app will store user data on centralised government servers rather than taking the decentralised approach advocated by Apple and Google, which are also developing a contact tracing app for other countries. Other nations in Europe including Germany, Switzerland, Estonia, Austria, and the Republic of Ireland have all opted for a decentralised system of contact tracing, in which data is stored locally on a user’s device, not sent to a central or government server.

The CEO of NHSX, Matthew Gould, said: “We’re balancing privacy with the need for the public health authorities to get insight into what contacts are more risky.” He added: “It was our view that a centralised approach gave us some very important data that gives serious insight into the virus. We will keep it under constant review and if we need to change, we will.”

A group of leading privacy advocates in the UK called into question the government’s centralised approach, writing in an open letter: “It is vital that, when we come out of the current crisis, we have not created a tool that enables data collection on the population, or on targeted sections of society, for surveillance.”

The director of Amnesty International UK, Kate Allen, said that the government should adopt the decentralised system. Ms Allen said: “We’re extremely concerned that the government may be planning to route private data through a central database, opening the door to pervasive state surveillance and privacy infringement, with potentially discriminatory effects.”

Conservative MP Marcus Fysh echoed this call, saying that “We are not a people who take well to surveillance.”

Matrix Chambers, a group of barristers in London, has also warned that the app may violate legal requirements on the sharing of public health data and has called on the government to clarify the legal status of the app.

The government is also working with tech companies to develop a so-called immunity passport. The firm Onfido has said that it will be able to launch a system in the coming months, which it describes as the “linchpin of the new normality”, according to The Guardian.

The system would require citizens to take a selfie with a form of government identification, creating a digital identity that would be tethered to test results for coronavirus provided by the NHS. The digital ID would create a QR code that would be scanned when entering a workplace and possibly other public spaces.

Apple and Google Promise to Ban Location Tracking in Apps Using ‘Contact Tracing’ Tech,2020/05/05,https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2020/05/05/apple-and-google-promise-to-ban-location-tracking-in-apps-using-contact-tracing-tech/,"Apple and Google have reportedly claimed that they will ban the use of location tracking in apps using the new contact tracing system being developed by the two tech giants that they say will help slow the spread of the Chinese virus.

Reuters reports that tech giants Apple and Google have promised to ban location tracking features in apps that take advantage of the new Wuhan coronavirus contact tracing system being developed together by the two Silicon Valley giants.


Apple and Google allege that unlike other systems, theirs will not collect location information or identifying information about those that test positive for the coronavirus. They also require that a person consent to the data that the companies do collect on them. The companies claim that health authorities will be able to include a way to verify that someone tested positive such as a QR code from a hospital, addressing concerns that people could falsely claim that they tested positive.

Google and Apple have both reportedly made changes to their mobile operating systems to allow the devices to exchange a private key with nearby smartphones via  Bluetooth, logging when users come into close proximity. If an individual tests positive for the Wuhan coronavirus and enters that information into an app, 14 days’ worth of their contact with other users is sent to a server.

The phones regularly check if any recently encountered individuals have been reported as infected and alerts users with a notification. The notification states that someone they have been in contact with has tested positive and provides them with more information. This system is running on mobile devices running iOS 13 or on any version of the Android operating system from 2015 on.

Software firm Twenty which developed the state of Utah’s Healthy Together contact tracing app which uses both GPS tracking and Bluetooth said on Monday that the app “operates effectively” without needing to rely on Apple and Google’s new system.

“If their approach can be more effective than our current solution, we’ll eagerly incorporate their features into our existing application, provided it meets the specifications of current and prospective public health partners,” Twenty said.

The province of Alberta in Canada, which does not collect GPS data, stated that it has no plans to adopt Apple and google’s system for its ABTraceTogether App.

9to5Mac previously reported that Apple and Google are now using the term “Exposure Notification” to describe their system instead of “Contact Tracing” in an attempt to emphasize the benefit of the system and make it sound less like a surveillance system.",Breitbart
Assault on Privacy: UK Contact Tracing App Data to be Stored on Government Servers,2020/04/30,https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2020/04/30/assault-on-privacy-uk-contact-tracing-app-data-to-be-stored-on-government-servers/,"The British government has announced that it will adopt a centralised approach to its planned contract tracing app, meaning that user data will be stored in government servers, sparking fears that the program could infringe upon privacy rights.

On Tuesday, the CEO of NHSX (the technology arm of the National Health Service), Mathe Gould told MPs that the United Kindom would be storing the data collected from the app on government servers, rather than taking the decentralised approach advocated by Apple and Google.


Gould said that the app should be released to the public in the next “two to three weeks”, with testing set to begin next week. Mr Gould said that the app will have “a measure of centralisation” as alerts will be sent out from NHS computers rather than from other phones in the area automatically triggering an alert.

“We don’t believe that’s a privacy endangering step,” Mr Gould said according to Sky News.

NHSX believes a centralised system will provide the government with more information on how the Chinese coronavirus is spreading, therefore enabling health officials to quickly update the app.

“One of the advantages is that it’s easier to audit the system and adapt it more quickly as scientific evidence accumulates,” Prof Christophe Fraser, an epidemiologist advising NHSX, told the BBC.

“The principal aim is to give notifications to people who are most at risk of having got infected, and not to people who are much lower risk,” he said, adding: “It’s probably easier to do that with a centralised system.”

In contrast to the UK, the European countries of Germany, Switzerland, Estonia, and Austria, as well as the Pan-European Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing (PEPP-PT) programme, have all adopted a decentralised approach to contact tracing in order to preserve privacy.

France remains the only major European power besides Britain currently pursuing a centralised government approach to tracking coronavirus patients. However, a group of tech and security experts within the country have penned an open letter, detailing the possible privacy concerns that a centralised approach brings with it.

Last month, a group of “responsible technologists” in the UK wrote to the head of NHSX and to Health Secretary Matt Hancock, warning that “location and contact tracking technology could be used as a means of social control”.

There are also concerns that the NSHX app will cause battery life issues in smartphones, as the app will constantly refresh in the background when a phone comes in contact with another phone running the program.

“If this is the case, take up of the app will be poor, and the project will not work very well. Australia, also using centralised matching, are having to constantly pester users via screen notifications when the app switches off,” said the privacy watchdog Open Rights Group.

“Battery life will be affected, and users will end up with screens unlocked, increasing security risks,” the group added.

Bipartisan Coalition Pushing $46 Billion Plan to Reopen U.S.,2020/04/29,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/04/29/bipartisan-coalition-pushing-46-billion-plan-to-reopen-u-s/,"A bipartisan coalition of former healthcare officials has been pushing a $46.5 billion plan to reopen the U.S. economy to Republican and Democrat congressional leaders as the coronavirus crisis continues.

NPR reported Monday the coalition includes former Planned Parenthood CEO Dr. Leana Wen, former Trump Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb, former Obama-era Medicare and Medicaid Acting Administrator Andy Slavitt, and former U.S. Senate Majority Leader Dr. Bill Frist (R).


“If you’re a Democrat, you like the fact that this creates jobs and helps local economies, and that it’s really good public health policy,” Dr. Bob Kocher, a former Obama special assistant who helped design the plan, told health media outlet STAT. “And if you’re a Republican, you’re not creating some sort of entitlement program here, you’re spending money for a near-term problem.”

STAT reported President Donald Trump’s senior adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner has fielded several calls from members of the coalition who are pitching the plan.

The proposal calls for $46.5 billion in funding to assist states in tracking down individuals who have been exposed to the Chinese coronavirus and isolating infected and exposed individuals.

The former health officials recommend breaking down the funding into three public health areas: $12 billion to expand the contact tracing workforce, $4.5 billion for use of vacant hotels for infected and exposed individuals to self-isolate, and $30 billion for 18 months of income support for individuals who volunteer to isolate themselves.

“There is no silver bullet in the fight against coronavirus,” Slavitt told NPR. “But if we want to get back to a more normal existence, we need to give states the tools they need to contain the virus.”

In a letter sent to Republican and Democrat leaders of Congress, the coalition wrote the “key to reopening the economy,” is “test, trace, and self-isolate”:

To begin to safely ease at-home measures, it is of paramount importance to be able to provide broad, timely testing for COVID-19; diagnose COVID-19 positive cases; enable infected individuals to self-isolate at home or voluntarily in other facilities (if home is not a safe option or if the individual is unsheltered); trace and alert those who have been exposed to an infected individual; and enable those exposed contacts to voluntarily self-isolate for 14 days after their last exposure to the infected person. This approach maximizes the chance new infections get contained before they turn into rapidly growing new outbreaks.

Significant attention has rightly been paid to the need to continue to ramp up the Nation’s capacity to execute COVID-19 testing, including in the most recent legislation. That must continue as current testing capacity and accuracy must be improved. This can only be accomplished with the availability of adequate supplies and approvals of new high-speed, high quality, fast tests by the FDA. We are writing to propose Congress take swift action in upcoming legislation to give states the funding necessary to scale up our nation’s contact tracing ability and support voluntary self-isolation of infected and exposed individuals. This is fundamental to our ability to begin to reopen our economy while continuing to safeguard American lives.

The coalition is aggressively urging for an “expansion of the contact tracing workforce,” by 180,000, until a vaccine for COVID-19 is on the market.

The group recommends that primary care providers become a referral source for testing and contact tracing.

“Congress should take steps to ensure the health of primary care practices and Medicare should establish a referral payment code for referring patients who test positive for Coronavirus to the proper contact tracing resources,” the letter said.

“We believe the direct impact of this investment, along with an adequate testing and containment infrastructure that links in health care providers and businesses, will have a significant economic impact,” the authors wrote, “allowing Americans to get back to work safely and quickly, create employment, stabilize our healthcare system, and stimulate the hospitality sector.”",Breitbart
Study: Majority of Americans Don’t Want or Can’t Use Google and Apple’s Coronavirus Tracing App,2020/04/29,https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2020/04/29/study-majority-of-americans-dont-want-or-cant-use-google-and-apples-coronavirus-tracing-app/,"According to a recent study, nearly 3 in 5 Americans say that they would be unable or unwilling to use the infection-alert apps being developed by Apple and Google to trace Wuhan coronavirus infections.

The Washington Post reports that according to a Washington Post–University of Maryland poll, almost 3 in 5 Americans say that they are either unable or unwilling to use the new infection-alert apps being developed by Apple and Google in an attempt to trace Wuhan coronavirus infections.


 

Breitbart News has reported that the tech giants have been working with public health authorities and university researchers to produce a system that would notify users who had come into close contact with a person who tested positive for the Wuhan coronavirus. This is done by using the Bluetooth system on users’ phones to “ping” other users around them.

But this system faces multiple barriers, such as the fact that 1 in 6 Americans do not own a smartphone, which is required to run the tracing app. Smartphone ownership amongst seniors is also extremely low with just over half of those aged 65 or older saying that they own a smartphone, this poses a particularly large barrier as older citizens are the most vulnerable to the coronavirus.

Among the 82 percent of American smartphone users, 50 percent said that they would probably use a tracing app and an equal percentage said they definitely would not. Willingness runs highest among Democrats and people who are worried about falling ill to the Wuhan coronavirus. Resistance to the tracing app is higher among Republicans and those with a lower level of worry about contracting the virus.

A major source of unease surrounding the apps was a distrust of Google, Apple, and tech firms in general with many worrying about their ability to protect the privacy of health data. 57 percent of smartphone users report having a “great deal” of trust in public health agencies while only 43 percent trust tech companies such as Apple and Google.

Reuters reports that after initially attempting to develop its own Wuhan coronavirus tracing tech, Germany has decided to adopt new tracing technology developed by Apple and Google, joining a growing number of other European countries.


German Chancellery Minister Helge Braun and Health Minister Jens Spahn said in a statement that the city of Berlin would adopt a “decentralized” approach to digital contact tracing meaning they would not be using a German-made system.

Apple and Google allege that unlike other systems, theirs will not collect location information or identifying information about those that test positive for the coronavirus. They also require that a person consent to the data that the companies do collect on them. The companies claim that health authorities will be able to include a way to verify that someone tested positive such as a QR code from a health care provider, addressing concerns that people could falsely claim that they tested positive.

The notification states that someone they have been in contact with has tested positive and provides them with more information. This system is running on mobile devices running iOS 13 or on any version of the Android operating system from 2015 on.

Up until recently, Germany was promoting a centralized system called Pan-European Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing (PEPP-PT), which needed Apple to change settings on its iPhones. But Apple reportedly refused to change any settings which forced the German government to adopt Apple’s new system.

Bran and Spahn commented that Germany will now be using a “strongly decentralized” system. “This app should be voluntary, meet data protection standards and guarantee a high level of IT security,” they said. “The main epidemiological goal is to recognize and break chains of infection as soon as possible.”

One of the members of PEPP-PT, Germany’s Fraunhofer HHI research institute, was told over the weekend that it would be taken off the contact tracing project. Fraunhofer HHI head Thomas Wiegand said in a message to colleagues: “A series of grave errors were made by PEPP-PT regarding communication that, at the end of the day, caused serious damage and led to this decision.”

Exclusive — South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem on Beating Coronavirus Without Lockdown: ‘We’re Much Better on Offense’,2020/04/22,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/04/22/exclusive-south-dakota-gov-kristi-noem-on-beating-coronavirus-without-lockdown-were-much-better-on-offense/,"South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, a Republican and the governor of one of just a handful of states that has not issued a statewide lockdown order, told Breitbart News exclusively on Wednesday her state is winning the war against the coronavirus without the extreme and draconian measures some other states have implemented.

Noem said that despite earlier projections of a surge on the hospitals in South Dakota and nationwide, “no, we haven’t” seen such a surge. In fact, South Dakota has—again, without a lockdown—cut that number down by 75 percent of the projections, with much less than a hundred people in the hospital.


 

According to the state’s Department of Health website, there have been 1,858 cases of coronavirus in South Dakota—937 people have recovered. There have been only 9 deaths, and there are 62 people currently hospitalized. In total, only 111 people were ever hospitalized for coronavirus in South Dakota—far less than ever was expected.

“I think we’ve got maybe 60 people in the hospital right now,” Noem said in an exclusive interview on Wednesday. “We have 2,500 beds set aside for COVID-19 patients, but we only have 63 in. We probably, from all of our projections and studying the science behind the virus, we won’t peak until the middle of June. But we already have done much better than what we had thought would have been hitting our state already.”

“We already have cut our peak projections by 75 percent just putting in place the recommendations I asked people to do, staying at home and they’ve practiced social distancing,” she explained. “They’ve washed their hands and they stayed home if they weren’t feeling well and called their doctors. Just by doing that, we’ve cut the hospitalization rates by 75 percent. So, I’ve just been super proud of what the people in South Dakota have done—they recognized that I wasn’t going to dictate to them, that I valued their freedoms and liberties and that I was going to let them take action on behalf of their families and communities.”

When asked how she made her decision to not issue a closure of businesses in South Dakota and to not issue a statewide stay-at-home order like many other governors did when the crisis was beginning, Noem told Breitbart News that she was focused on providing the best and most scientific response to the coronavirus crisis.

“I looked at our state and our people here and knew they would take on the personal responsibility that would be necessary to protect their families and their communities,” Noem said. “I had a real honest conversation with them and told them what we were facing and that I needed them to make some decisions to follow CDC guidelines and that by doing that we could look at how this virus would impact our state and peak hospitalization rates going forward and do it together.”

“I’m not one who believes in a one-size-fits-all approach, and even in South Dakota I’ve got pretty diverse communities,” she noted. “I’ve got some that are pretty sparse with not many people and then I’ve got some that are big cities as well. So I wanted to leave some flexibility there for local folks to make decisions but also recognizing that when it comes down to it that these guys had to take on the personal responsibility that is necessary to really go after this virus.”

Noem added that when it came to her decision against issuing a lockdown, she factored in her oath to defend the state’s Constitution that she took when she was sworn in as governor and her oath to defend the U.S. Constitution that she took when she was previously sworn in when she was in the U.S. Congress. She was concerned for the civil liberties and freedoms of the people of her state and did not think the facts on the ground warranted a lockdown—something that, again, the statistics have proven to be true.


 
“It was a decision that I made. The facts on the ground here did not support shelter-in-place,” she said. “We just didn’t have the spread. For me personally, I took an oath to uphold our state Constitution. I took an oath when I was in Congress to uphold the United States Constitution. So I believe in people’s freedoms and liberties and I always balance that with every decision that I make as governor. I get overly concerned with leaders who take too much power in a time of crisis because I think that’s how we directly lose our country someday by leaders overstepping their proper role.”

“So I was balancing all of that perspective and my value system and principles with what I was seeing here in South Dakota and never believed it was appropriate for us to take that kind of action,” Noem explained. “I trust my people. I know that if business owners here are given an opportunity to be innovative, they will protect their customers. They will take actions and change business models to make sure their employees are safe and that they can practice social distancing while still serving their customers. I knew I had to give them an opportunity to survive.”

“What I was going to ask them to do was not going to be something they would have to do just for a week or two,” she explained. “I knew they would have to do it for months, and I didn’t know how they would survive if I shut them down, and for me, it’s always been about whatever I ask you to do today you have to sustain, and I knew that doing that kind of an action was not sustainable. People would not be able to shelter in their homes for six weeks on end, and businesses would not be able to survive and have an economy to be able to put food on the table for folks.”


“All of that was part of my decision-making process, and I decided as well—I knew it was unconventional and it was something that would not be widely embraced across the country–but I knew I had to communicate it and I knew I had to make myself available to South Dakota and tell them why I was making these decisions and make sure we were having real palms-up honest conversations, and I think by and large they’re seeing the wisdom in the action and decisions we’ve made, and they’re grateful for it, but we have a long ways to go though,” Noem said. “We’ve got, that’s the thing, a lot of people want to be done with this now, and I have to keep reminding people we still have not even hit our peak—our numbers are going to continue to get worse, and that reality is something that we’re going to have to deal with for quite some time here.”

Just because there is no stay-at-home order or statewide mandated closure of businesses does not mean South Dakota is just waiting and doing nothing to fight the coronavirus. Noem has undertaken a number of initiatives in South Dakota, including alongside the state’s northern neighbor, North Dakota, the introduction of a cell phone application that helps state health officials with contact tracing of those who test positive for the virus—something she said has been very effective in helping control the spread of the disease.


 
“The app is called CARE19 and it’s downloadable on both android and iPhones, but what it does is so much of the time of individuals—when somebody tests positive for COVID-19 our Department of Health immediately calls them, asks them to isolate, and then follows up with them and then also does extensive interviews with them to find out about where they had been the previous three or four or five days, where they had been, where they had stopped, so we can identify other individuals that may have been exposed to the virus to let them know and ask them to isolate and slow down the spread,” Noem said. “This app will do all of that in seconds. So, it’s completely voluntary. People can download it on their phone, then turn on location services and then forget about it. Then if they do test positive a week or two weeks down the road they can decide if they want to share that information with us or not and then that will tell us everything about where they were and people that may have been exposed to the virus so they don’t have to try to remember.”

“It literally takes hours of interviews we would have with an individual down to getting all of that same information and having it be much more accurate in seconds,” she explained. “It helps us be much more aggressive in slowing and isolating the spread. The average person we have to contact—if somebody tests positive, we have to call eight or nine people on average that they may have come in contact with and let them know. So even if we only have a hundred cases a day, that’s 800 to 900 phone calls we have to be making to them. Then everybody who tests positive and everybody who has been exposed we call them back the next day and then the next day and so on to make sure they’re still doing okay and that they’re still isolating and all that. By being able to cut down that amount of time it takes to know who may have been exposed, boy it just saves us hundreds of hours and is really helpful. We’re the only—I think North Dakota started it first, I think we started it the next morning, and I think we’re the only two states that are using that kind of technology.”

South Dakota has also, at Noem’s direction, formally launched a statewide, fully-funded, and all-encompassing trial to study the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine as a potential treatment for coronavirus. There have been some studies that suggest the drug is promising as a potential treatment, and President Donald Trump has touted it as a hopeful possibility, while the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized its usage on a compassionate care basis if a doctor decides a patient should use it. But no formal studies yet exist to demonstrate the effectiveness of the antimalarial hydroxychloroquine against COVID-19, so Noem stepped up and rallied all of the state’s major healthcare systems to lead a statewide test of the drug.


 
“What’s happening here in South Dakota is really unprecedented,” Noem said. “There has never been anything like this that has happened before. There is the state government partnering with all of our major health systems to run a statewide, state-backed-and-funded clinical trial. We have Sanford Health in our state that does a lot of research, and they’re running many other clinical trials, and they came to the table and said they would lead it, and I said the state would support it and help secure the drugs with the White House’s help, the hydroxychloroquine and whatever else we would need, and then the other two health systems, Avera and Monument, were excited to partner as well. So we will literally have a clinical trial now where every person in the state will be allowed to participate in.”

“So it’s the first statewide one. I think we’re the only state where it would have been possible to get all of the healthcare systems to agree to participate in,” she continued. “It really is unprecedented as well to get them all to step up and agree to participate, and then we can include up to 100,000 people so it is much larger than a typical clinical trial would be.”

“Sometimes the accuracy of a clinical trial is in question when it’s a super small sample and you don’t get enough people to participate,” Noem explained. “By this, including this many people getting access to the drug and seeing what the results would be, not only allows us to meet the current need but also allows us to get the background data and research that we can use to be on offense against this virus into the future.”

“So, I think this is kind of what South Dakota does best—we’re much better on offense than we are just sitting back and playing defense, and this is one way where I said let’s not just sit back and access the drug and let people use it that are in ICUs and in healthcare systems that need it to save their lives,” she said. “But let’s use it as an opportunity to build out our capacity for doing research so that in the long run we’re contributing to addressing COVID-19 for years into the future.”

South Dakota is still, Noem added, planning to have fireworks over Mount Rushmore this year—a promise President Trump made when signing a phase one trade deal with China earlier this year.

“They are—we’ll decide what it looks like but there will be fireworks over Mount Rushmore this year. We’re still moving ahead,” Noem said.",Breitbart
Michigan Hires ‘Tech Provider to Democratic Campaigns’ to Collect Medical Data on Coronavirus Patients,2020/04/21,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/04/21/michigan-hires-tech-provider-to-democratic-campaigns-to-collect-medical-data-on-coronavirus-victims/,"Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s (D) administration has hired a progressive campaign organization to collect private medical data on coronavirus patients.

The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services said in a release:


 

As part of efforts to continue expanding COVID-19 testing and contact tracing of potentially exposed Michiganders, the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS) again expanded its testing criteria to include all essential workers still reporting to work in person, whether they have symptoms or not, and launched a large-scale effort with more than 2,000 volunteers to expand contact tracing capacity. …

Contact tracing is a proven public health strategy that involves identifying those affected by COVID-19 and interviewing friends, families and others near that person about their contacts and symptoms. MDHHS is contracting with Great Lakes Community Engagement, a firm that specializes in outreach campaigns to engage citizens, and Every Action VAN, a voter/individual contact platform used by non-profits, to provide software to help organize remote phone banking and track information and contacts.

“Great Lakes Community Engagement” has no discernible presence on the Internet. A request from Breitbart News to MDHHS for more information on the seemingly obscure organization was not immediately answered.

“Every Action VAN” is “trusted by” Planned Parenthood, SEIU, NARAL, and NextGen Climate, according to its website.

Related to that company is NGP VAN, which bills itself as “the leading political technology provider to Democratic & progressive campaigns & organizations.”

Livingston County Commissioner Wes Nakagiri was the first to discover the connection after he volunteered to perform contact tracing for the state.

According to Nakagiri’s website:

When performing contact tracing, volunteers are assigned to assist Public Health officials in reaching out to citizens who have come into contact with someone who has been diagnosed with the coronavirus.  The volunteers make phone calls to convey important instructions to citizens who have a higher likelihood of contracting the coronavirus. Additionally, volunteers could ask personal questions such as: How is your health now? Do you have shortness of breath? Do you have abdominal pain? Can you tell me the names and ages of persons living in your household? What is your email address? The volunteers then log the results of these phone calls into a database ostensibly for use by medical professionals.

Nakagiri said the training documents tell volunteers to enter confidential medical information gained from contact tracing “into the NGP VAN database.”


 
“This enables NGP VAN to share this confidential information with both the MDHHS and Democrat candidates,” Nakagiri said.

“Providing confidential information collected from contact tracing to Democrat candidates is an egregious violation of the public trust.”",Breitbart
"Exclusive – Adm. Brett Giroir Details Public Health Infrastructure to Reopen America: ‘Surveillance, Testing, Contact Tracing’",2020/04/14,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/04/14/exclusive-adm-brett-giroir-details-public-health-infrastructure-to-reopen-america-surveillance-testing-contact-tracing/,"Adm. Brett Giroir, the assistant secretary for health (ASH), told Breitbart News exclusively on Tuesday that the federal government is developing a broad-based effort consisting of wide-scale testing, surveillance, and contact tracing to be able to control the spread of coronavirus once the president makes the decision to reopen America.

Giroir is a four-star admiral in the United States Public Health Service Commissioned Corps (USPHS), the federal uniformed service of the Public Health Service, and as ASH, a top adviser to the secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS). He is a member of President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence’s White House Coronavirus Task Force and has emerged as the so-called “testing czar.” In that role, Giroir is charged with the logistics of scaling up U.S. efforts to test for coronavirus from about 100,000 when he took over the effort just a few weeks ago to now more than 3 million tests completed as he told Breitbart News on Tuesday.


“Over 3 million as of today,” Giroir told Breitbart News, referring to various diagnostic tests that have been completed testing whether an American has an active coronavirus infection. In the hotspots throughout the United States, Giroir added, the U.S. is leading the world in not just the testing total but also testing per capita—far ahead of places like South Korea and elsewhere worldwide that have been lauded on testing.

“In the places where there’s a lot of disease like New York and Washington, we far exceed South Korea—far exceed South Korea—we have the most testing per capita of any place in the world,” Giroir said. “But if you have states where it’s circulating less, we don’t. But I want to be clear, in the states with really high circulation our testing is extraordinarily good.”

The next stages of combating the outbreak, he explained, will be preparing for the reopening of the country with a multi-pronged public health infrastructure approach including surveillance, expanded testing, and contact tracing, but also an expanded hospital capacity as well as wide-scale serological testing.

“Let me put it into context: All of the testing that we’ve done thus far is testing for the virus in your nose or nasopharynx, meaning you’re actively infected with the virus,” Giroir said when asked about the testing scaling up especially on the serological side. “The antibody test will get us an idea of if you have been infected in the past and are presumably—not 100 percent certain but probably by all known medical computation—that you would be immune to getting the virus again at least in the intermediate term. It is an important component, but it is not really the whole foundation of where we’re going. I call it a component because it will tell us who had the virus and give us a good sort of understanding of what happened, but we still expect only a minority of people will have had the virus and have recovered from it. The outer estimates—and again we don’t know—maybe it’s as much as five or ten percent in some places, and that’s going to be very important to know who those five or ten percent of people are both for themselves and others, but it’s not the total solution.”

Giroir said that to reopen the country there needs to be a number of logistical public health structures in place that the administration is racing to get together as quickly as possible while the disease’s spread levels off. They include surveillance—or monitoring through existing structures that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) uses for other diseases to make sure the government is on top of any emerging potential hotspots before they break out big like right now—as well as expanded testing and contact tracing systems.

“To get everyone back together, and I’m sorry to be geeky; it’s very important to have a number of things in place,” Giroir said. “Number one, surveillance. So is this virus circulating in the country? Right now, I think we had 22,000 new cases yesterday. But as it gets lower, sort of is it circulating and where is it circulating? This is apparent from both testing and what the CDC says would be syndromic surveillance, like if you come in with a cough and a fever and influenza-like illness. This is a very good system to understand. In the summer, if you see people like that, it’s not flu—it’s going to be COVID-19. The second component is actively testing people with symptoms. That’s what we’re doing now. But we need it on a sort of generally available sort of scale. It depends on how many cases there are. If there’s 20,000 cases, or let’s say there’s 10,000 cases a day in the U.S., then you need 10,000 tests and you probably need to oversample. For every positive test, you want five to ten negative tests. So, then for every positive person you’re going to contact trace four to five people. So that’s kind of the milieu of what happens—surveillance, testing, and contact tracing is really defining it, plus the antibody on the other side. As I said last week, we are going to have for a test—we’re going to be in the range of the number of tests that we need to do this in a very short period of time, just a few weeks.”

In addition to those things—the increased testing and the public health infrastructure necessary to monitor and control the spread of the disease—Giroir also mentioned the importance of hospital capacity to treat any new patients.

“There are sort of three big buckets, and again when the president is ready to roll this out and to input all the factors he will do that but I’m just saying as I see it,” Giroir said. “There are three big buckets. Number one is the capacity in the hospitals. We don’t want to ‘open up the country’ if the hospitals are overrun. I think it’s very important for people to understand that if they get sick, and there may be people who get sick even when we open the country back up so to speak, that they can be well taken care of in the hospital. The second piece is the availability of the array and the ecosystem of tests deployed the right way. Again, I think we will have that. Third is the public health sector infrastructure. To me, this is probably the long pole in the tent to make sure the state and local public health departments are fully capable of doing the contact tracing and outbreak investigations that are needed on the downslope of the disease. Again, we can’t wait for three years in our homes to make sure that there’s not a single case out there. The country is going to have to be opened progressively, regionally, based on risk categories of people while it’s still circulating. So again, hospital infrastructure, public health infrastructure, and the array of tests including surveillance that are necessary to do—those are the three factors.”

Regarding the term “surveillance,” Giroir said this is a system that the CDC uses for other diseases to keep the government ahead of the curve of any outbreak in the future.

“Surveillance is kind of what goes on in the background that would identify that there might be COVID cases circulating,” Giroir said. “This is not like actively diagnosing people. This is like taking tests from people in the emergency room who might not otherwise think they have COVID. It’s also about, and there’s a whole network of this already arranged by the CDC—that’s what we do with flu on a normal period, and now that you have a COVID test you can do that with this. Also, there’s what we call syndromic surveillance. This is very effective in how we know where flu is hitting. Indeed, this year, the third wave of ‘flu’ this year was not flu at all—it was COVID. So this is sort of the background—it’s like your radar system out there trying to figure out where there might be cases where you might not even know where the cases are. Or if you see an upsurge in people with cough and fever in, say, San Antonio, we know that instantaneously. That’s something different than active testing. Active testing is when a person is coming in, they have COVID, and I’m testing them for it. It’s not the sort of background surveillance that’s ongoing no matter what’s happening. If that person is positive, and again for every positive we hope people are testing five, seven, eight that we suspect but are negative—because if everybody you test is positive, you’re not testing enough people.”


Giroir also explained how contact tracing works through the CDC in partnership with state and local health officials.

“Contact tracing is for every person who’s positive the CDC says on average there are probably five close contacts that they have interacted with,” Giroir said. “So the idea is to identify and call those people—and this done by local public health officials. Some of those people will need to be tested, and then isolated. If they’re positive or at-risk, we need to keep them chilled away until we determine if they’ve been infected or haven’t been infected and can go back. That’s the idea of contact tracing. You have a person who’s sick, they test positive, you then trace those near contacts who could if infected spread the virus independent of that person. That’s a very, very important component.”

Part of the reason why the strategy shifted to “mitigation,” or the wide-scale national distancing and state-by-state lockdowns nationwide, is because the spread was happening too quickly to handle contact tracing to fight the coronavirus. Giroir said when the numbers of new cases drop to a more manageable number, public health officials will be able to handle it.

“When you’ve got 40,000 or 50,000 new cases a day, your New York City contact tracing program can’t do it because there’s too many people,” Giroir said. “But when you’re on the downslope or at the potential upslope, contact tracing is really critical. When you’re down to 500 or 1,000 new cases in the country, you want to make sure 1,000 doesn’t turn into 50,000—and testing and contact tracing is the way to do that. Those are all there—those are all there from CDC. It just depends on what stage of the outbreak you’re in. If so many people in New York have it, it’s useless to contract trace—you shelter in place, which is what the president asked. But when you get to lower numbers and you’re not doing that, then contact tracing is important as well as if there’s a new upsurge say in the fall or the end of the summer—then identification and contact tracing are really, really important. They’re really important when you have low numbers circulating. When you’re in an all-out full pandemic, you can’t contact trace everybody who’s got it. You got to socially distance and stay away.”

When an area or a region reopens, Giroir said, the tell that it was either successful—or not—will be the numbers of cases that happen in that area.

“You look for new cases,” Giroir replied when asked how officials will know when a place reopens if it was the right call. “If there’s an upsurge in new cases that can’t be controlled in contact tracing, then it’s the wrong decision. So it’s really—how we know if it’s the right decision depends on the surveillance and the identification of new cases. If you open up an area, and the number of new cases continues to go down or smolder at a low level then that’s great. If you have another big upsurge in cases, you have a real problem on your hands. That’s why the contact tracing and testing is so important. But I think it’s really that simple. If you see them going back up again and you can’t control the spread, you got a big problem on your hands and you got to deal with that. In order to avoid that, that’s why we need good surveillance, good testing, and good contact tracing so you don’t get in that situation.”

Giroir also said that serological tests, which tell someone if they have already been infected and recovered and have the antibodies, will very soon be available by the “tens of millions” per month in various places nationwide. He said it is up to the White House Coronavirus Task Force coordinator Dr. Deborah Birx to determine the distribution of those tests—which will be a finger-prick test that can easily be done in many places like a doctor’s office or a pharmacy—when they first come out in the coming weeks.

“We expect that there will be finger-prick tests that can be done in the tens of millions per month,” Giroir said. “The tests will certainly be available and there will be no limiting factors—it really depends on how Dr. Birx and how the task force wants to deploy them. Where do the first 20 million tests go? Where do the first 30 million tests go? But it’s a completely different situation that we’ve seen with this because it’s a finger-prick. It can’t be done at home, but it can be administered at basically any lab and can probably even be administered at pharmacies and nursing homes all across the country. We’ve conducted 3 million tests so far for the virus, which is probably an under-estimate. I would expect the first month of the serologic tests to likely have between 10 million and 20 million done in that first month.”

Giroir added that within the next several months after these serological finger-prick tests are rolled out, as the tens of millions of them per month are distributed, anyone who wants a test will be able to get one nationwide.

“That’s really a decision of the task force under the leadership of Dr. Birx,” Giroir said when asked how and where they will be sent when they come out. “One might imagine that it should be regionally done, and also done where there’s the highest risk. I’m not ready to tell you that because it really is part of the overall comprehensive plan, but one might imagine that regions that have been hardest hit and need to open might be some of those, and for people like healthcare workers who need to know who has been infected, who’s immune and who’s not. There is a strategy here. This is the kind of test that over the next six months basically anyone who wants a test can get a test because it’s going to be out in the tens of millions. But again like everything else, where does the first 10 million or 20 million tests go? How do we deploy that effectively to support the president’s strategy?”

Giroir concluded this interview with Breitbart News by saying that President Trump is making the “absolute right analogy” to consider this fight against coronavirus a wartime effort against an “invisible enemy.”

“I tell you, number one it’s a ‘Whole of America’ approach,” Giroir said. “I didn’t live through World War II, but we didn’t have 10,000 B-17s the moment World War II hit. We didn’t have all the tanks. It took the entire American infrastructure working together to get the supplies to work together what we need. I’m in the uniformed public health service and I’m sitting next to people in the Army and the Navy and FEMA—all working together in a very rigorous military kind of structure, an incident management structure. We have a lot of people dying; we have a lot of people dying and we have a lot of people sick. So I think this is an all-out effort in the country—military, civilians, federal, state, local, the entire American industrial base, and most importantly the American people working together. If the American people did not listen to the president and the Task Force and do the physical distancing, we would be losing this because we don’t have drugs now and we don’t have vaccines, but we do have a weapon—that public health weapon—that we’ve employed for people to physically distance and avoid the kind of gatherings and that’s how we’re getting ahead. In the future, we’ll have better weapons. We’ll have the B-29 bomber; we will have the cruise missiles; we will have the stealth bombers. Right now we don’t. But what we do have we are deploying effectively to get ahead, and we are clearly getting ahead of it. Just listen to the leadership and we will be good.”

Giroir also said he thinks what President Trump is doing by providing lengthy briefings and taking questions from the media daily on this issue is providing an “unprecedented” level of transparency to the public on everything that’s happening with the effort.

“The other thing that’s unprecedented is the president is at the podium every single day answering questions,” Giroir said. “I mean, I can’t imagine a time when the president and the vice president have been so transparent bringing everyone together to answer the questions the American people have and to make sure communication is clear. The Task Force meetings aren’t a media prep, they’re real important meetings about the issues we are facing in America done in a very highly professional, scientific, and multi-disciplinary kind of way and that is being explained to the American people completely transparently. I think that’s unprecedented.”
