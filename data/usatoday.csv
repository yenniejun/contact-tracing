And cruise ships have been at the center of the drama as passengers have been quarantined and crew members trapped on board. Now, cruise lines need to find new ways to make sure passengers feel safe when boardings resume after the CDC's no-sail order expires in July. Multiple companies are moving ahead with technology that could be implemented on ships so that cruisers can return to sea with less worry – though most cruise lines haven't announced specific plans. Infrared Cameras Inc. announced in a press release, however, that the company is partnering with Carnival Cruise Line to screen passenger and crew member temperatures via thermal camera systems. USA TODAY has reached out to Carnival for more information. 'Hygiene is the new luxury':How cruise ship design could evolve to ward against outbreaks Cleaning a floating petri dish:How is a cruise ship sanitized after a coronavirus outbreak? One technology that could be implemented to disinfect heavy-traffic areas on cruise ships is far-UVC light. Far-UVC light has the capability to scramble the genetic material of viruses such as coronavirus, effectively sanitizing the air, surfaces or even people. ""Ultraviolet light in general has been used to kill bacteria and viruses for a very long time,"" David Brenner, director at the Columbia University Center for Radiological Research, told USA TODAY. It's been known to kill bacteria and viruses for the last century and for the last two to three decades has been used to disinfect surgical theaters or hospital wards. ""It's being used in the MTA here in New York, in the wee hours between 1 a.m. and 5  a.m. when the MTA is closed down,"" he added, referencing the Metropolitan Transportation Authority public transit vehicles and some fixed locations being sanitized with UV light. ""It’s been in use to kill viruses and sterilize locations when people aren’t around, which is not ideal because even if you have a sterilized location at 9 o’clock in the morning and people start coming in, they’re potentially gong to contaminate."" Far-UVC light, which Brenner's team has been working with for the past seven to eight years, can be used to sterilize space while people are around, making it ideal for use in crowded public spaces, including cruise ships. UVC light is similar to coffee at varying temperatures, Fred Maxik, the founder and CTO of Healthe, a company creating sanitation structures with far-UVC light, told USA TODAY. When its wavelength is too long, it's like hot coffee and can burn you. But at the right length (approximately 222 nanometers), far-UVC can't damage living human cells – it disinfects without harming people, Maxik explained. ""Essentially what we found is the wavelength from the UV light, which while still being able to kill bacteria and viruses, it’s not a safety hazard for human exposure,"" Brenner said. ""If we can reduce the level of virus in occupied spaces, we are undoubtedly going to reduce risk of person-to-person transmission."" Separately, Healthe is trying to implement far-UVC light to sanitize people and spaces on cruise ships. ""There are a number of areas you can imagine right away,"" Maxik said. ""Embarkation areas, high-traffic areas around concierge desks, greeting counters, larger gathering spaces, places people get together in small groups like elevators or vestibules – those would be the obvious first places."" He said it would feel a little like Transportation Security Administration checks at the airport: People would go through a portal-like entryway that would emit far-UVC rays that can sanitize boarding crew members and passengers. A passenger would walk in, raise their arms, do a slow, full turn, and then walk through.  The idea is that the portal will ""clean the pathogens off your clothing, off your skin, off any packaging you might carry with you as you walk into the space,"" he said. ""And it does so by essentially disrupting the genetic material of those pathogens."" Packages could also be sanitized in this way, Maxik said. And in some areas, such as bathrooms, typical lights could be replaced with far-UVC lights to continuously sanitize the area. Maxik said the company is in talks with a few major cruise companies about implementing far-UVC light, though he was unable to share which cruise lines at the time of the interview.  Destroying viral genetic material isn't the only way to stop the spread of illnesses like coronavirus on a ship.  Indoor data intelligence can provide cruise lines with insight on where people are congregating, where people might need to be dispersed and who came in contact with whom in case of a viral outbreak on board – all from a signal that each mobile device emits. The cruise ships could monitor their passengers anonymously through their signals, giving the lines an idea of when to ask people to move along. Nadir Ali, the CEO of Inpixon, an indoor data intelligence company, who has worked with cruise lines and hotels, is aiming to incorporate the technology to help safely monitor passengers and lessen fears around cruising. Inpixon specifically can collect and use data acquired using radio frequency scanners that pick up on Wi-Fi, Bluetooth signals and cellular signals.  Cruise operators could view a ship's map, which would be coded in green, yellow and red based on crowd-density levels. ""If a certain deck is turning yellow to red, maybe [someone] needs to go make sure [it isn't too crowded],"" Ali said.  But it could be used for more than crowd control. ""If, God forbid, a patient starts developing symptoms or has come down with COVID-19 or some other virus or flu or something, [the cruise line] could also [ask if] that person can identify themselves,"" he explained. The software used for indoor data intelligence captures a unique code emitted by a phone as part of its signal, Ali explained, but it is encrypted and kept anonymous. However, in a health emergency, those codes could be used. Public health mobile apps:Apple and Google release coronavirus contact tracing technology If the infected person chose to share their information, the cruise line could then determine where that individual had been on board, indicating which areas may need a deeper cleaning in case of contaminated surfaces or whether an area should be closed off. It would also allow the cruise line to identify what other phones and people were in similar proximity – and may have been exposed. While digital contact tracing could be very effective, it also breaches the issue of privacy, which Ali addressed, noting the company never attaches a person's identification to their address unless they choose to have that happen. ""We want to make sure people are consenting and opting in to this process to make sure we protect their privacy,"" he said. Since the idea of contact tracing with coronavirus emerged though, it has come with skepticism from the public. ""There are conflicting interests,"" said Tina White, a Stanford University researcher who first introduced a privacy-protecting approach in February. ""Governments and public health (agencies) want to be able to track people"" to minimize the spread of COVID-19, but people are less likely to download a voluntary app if it is intrusive, she said. And Apple and Google are releasing coronavirus contact tracing applications that can alert people anonymously if they have been in the vicinity of an infected person. While the technology keeps the system anonymous, nearly 3 in 5 Americans still said they would be unwilling or unable to use Google and Apple's contact tracing technology, according to a Washington Post-University of Maryland poll.

1,1,Fact check: Bill Gates did not craft contact tracing billMatthew Brown ,"May 27, 2020",https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2020/05/26/fact-check-bill-gates-did-not-help-craft-hr-6666-contact-tracing-bill/5220823002/,"As communities around the country begin to ease social distancing measures, debates about how to ensure public health have intensified. Discussion has especially targeted recently introduced House legislation, H.R. 6666: COVID-19 Testing, Reaching, And Contacting Everyone Act, which would fund $100 billion for the work of various medical groups which perform COVID-19 testing. Claims that the bill has been influenced by outside corporations or business elites feature prominently. ""This is what Bill Gates and George Soros want to do...Secretly stick you with a chip while testing you for the coronavirus...the Dems have a bill on the house floor ready to vote on it to require this....House Bill 6666...."" a graphic on Facebook shared nearly 200 times reads. Various other claims suggest the TRACE Act permits mass surveillance of individuals, as well as mandated quarantines and vaccinations. The TRACE Act does not allow for any of these things, and Bill Gates was not involved in the crafting of the bill. Sponsored by Rep. Bobby Rush, D-Ill., the TRACE Act would provide $100 billion to faith-based groups, medical centers and other organizations that offer COVID-19 testing. The funding would be intended to help expand coronavirus testing as well as the purchase of personal protective equipment for medical professionals. Contact tracing is the public health practice of documenting where an infected person may have been and with whom he interacted so health officials can accurately estimate the spread of virus. The process may involve the collection of documents, interviewing exposed individuals as well as the use of technology to monitor people's movements. The TRACE Act does not specify a preference for any form of contact tracing and does not designate a role for the federal government in collecting data on people or using it for any means. The bill does give funding priority to groups that operate in low-income and minority communities. “The bill does not force you or your loved ones to do anything at all,” a press release from Rush’s office reads. “With that being said, if you or a loved one does have the coronavirus, it is advised that you do self-quarantine and maintain social distance from others.” Jeremy Edwards, a spokesman for Rush, confirmed that no private firms or outside groups were consulted while crafting the legislation. He also said Rush was indirectly advised on the subject after participating “in a number of briefings and calls with various agencies, including the CDC, on the importance of contact tracing.” Neither Microsoft nor the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation have advocated for the TRACE Act. The Gates Foundation denied involvement in the crafting of the TRACE Act in a statement to USA TODAY. ""In our home state of Washington, our staff have provided advisory support to public health officials on their COVID-19 response efforts. This has included participating in discussions about epidemiological approaches, such as testing, isolation, contact tracing and quarantine. The Gates Foundation has not provided grant funding to expand contact tracing in the U.S.,"" the statement reads. In early March, the Gates Foundation began funding expanded home testing for COVID-19 in the Seattle area but the program was halted by the Food and Drug Administration in May, pending further oversight. Since the coronavirus pandemic began sweeping the globe, Gates has spoken positively about various efforts to curtail the virus, including contact tracing. Gates devoted a section of his April 23 essay on the pandemic to contact tracing efforts, writing it is “unlikely” that Western countries will adopt the more stringent contact tracing efforts as have been seen in countries like China, Singapore and South Korea. “I think most countries will use the approach that Germany is using, which requires interviewing everyone who tests positive and using a database to make sure there is follow-up with all the contacts,” Gates continued. The Germans separately implemented several of the practices proposed in the TRACE Act. Germany at first proposed a centralized model of data collection for its digital contact tracing efforts but has since opted for a decentralized strategy, similar to those developed by American technology companies to be deployed by local authorities. Gates argued in that same essay, as well as during an April 27 Vox interview, that contact tracing efforts were necessary for reopening efforts to succeed. “Right now, in the U.S., we have not filled the testing and contact tracing structure or innovations, much less these secondary therapeutic or vaccine innovations,” he told Vox. Gates also spoke favorably about efforts by tech companies to develop digital means of contact tracing, like a Bluetooth mechanism jointly established by Apple and Google. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation has supported efforts to increase research into testing for COVID-19 since early February but has not directly funded any contact tracing initiatives. While Bill Gates is a staunch proponent of expanding testing for COVID-19, as well as stronger contact tracing efforts, he wasn’t involved in developing the TRACE Act.

2,2,I'm a coronavirus contact tracer. Asking vulnerable people to stay home isn't always easy.Shawna Sherman ,"Jun. 3, 2020",https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/voices/2020/06/03/coronavirus-contact-tracer-covid-19-california-column/5309779002/,"Just three months ago, I worked as a librarian at the San Francisco Public Library's Main Branch, where I answered questions on a reference desk. Now, I spend my days calling strangers to ask: Have you had any novel coronavirus symptoms in the last three days? Are you able to stay at home? Can we monitor your symptoms? And, by the way, have you been tested?   SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, is so easily spread that if you are in close contact with someone who has it, it's my job as a contact tracer to help make sure you stay home. As part of the contact tracing team for the City of San Francisco, I do this work from home on my computer. Some days my list of calls to make are few, some days the list approaches a dozen. Often a contact's first language is Spanish because, here in San Francisco, the pandemic has affected the Hispanic and Latino/a populations hardest: they make up 15% of the population, but 47% of cases. Pandemic historian:Don't rush reopening. In 1918, some states ran straight into more death. Under the current health order in San Francisco, those who have been exposed to the virus should quarantine for 14 days after their last contact with a positive case, and isolate, if they become symptomatic or test positive themselves. The city's tracing team is a partnership between University of California San Francisco (UCSF), the San Francisco Department of Public Health, and Dimagi a software company. We are a group of  more than 150 — including contact investigators who gather the names of contacts from positive cases — working to help slow the spread of COVID-19.   I am proud to be part of a team helping our community by connecting people with information that can save lives. Most of us are not health professionals; many, like me, are city workers reassigned during the emergency pandemic. There is a clinician on each team and we're working four hour shifts most days from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. It's not the easiest job. Some contacts simply don't want to talk; some are audibly sick; some are distraught over hospitalized family members; and some are reluctant to share personal information, possibly distrustful of a government that has discriminated against their community or worried about their immigration status. I wonder: Am I being culturally sensitive; am I gathering all the right information; can I convince the person I'm talking to to stay home? There is a gravity to this request. Staying home is difficult for people who have to leave their house to work, for those who don't have a home or are in a congregate living situation where it would be virtually impossible to isolate. In the workflow developed by UCSF, we have a guide and procedure to connect contacts to resources for help with food, cleaning supplies, testing or housing, and I hope they are able to take advantage of them. An opportunity for reform:COVID-19 highlights racial disparities in our health care system Studies have shown that even people who don't have symptoms can be carriers of the virus and they could be contagious while asymptomatic. In light of this research, as shelter-in-place is lifted and we slowly begin remaking our social lives, it will be more important for contact tracers across the country to act fast to trace positive cases and their contacts to stop the virus from spreading through our community like wildfire. I am grateful and relieved when people say they are staying home, that they want to keep the community healthy. I listen when people want to share how anxious this disease has made them, how hard it is not knowing whether a stuffy nose and fever is the disease. Sometimes I say, yeah, I'm anxious too. It's scary being this close to the pandemic. One day, I talked to a man who was at home in a residential hotel in the city's tenderloin neighborhood, an area notorious for homelessness and drug abuse. The virus has hit this area of the city the hardest. He told me he was going to do all he could to quarantine even though it was difficult in his environment.  Then I mentioned I used to work in his neighborhood at the Main Library and he said he used to go there every day for the computers. Had we talked once in person? I bet we have, I said. And we both imagined a day when we would be back in the library. Our conversation is confidential, I told him, but if you're comfortable, come to the third floor and say hi when this is all over. And hopefully it will be if we all do our part.  Shawna Sherman works as a coronavirus contact tracer in San Francisco."
3,3,Fact Check: Contact tracing won't result in people forcibly removed from their homesAdrienne Dunn ,"May 28, 2020",https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2020/05/28/fact-check-trace-act-hr-6666-wont-forcibly-remove-people-their-homes/5199873002/,"As states begin to reopen and Americans return to work, local governments and health officials are tasked with monitoring the spread of the coronavirus to proactively address any potential outbreaks.  One method for tracking the spread is contact tracing, a process of identification of individuals who may have come into contact with an infected person. On May 1, U.S. Rep. Bobby Rush, D-Illinois, introduced a contact tracing proposal that would help local agencies identify people who were exposed to the coronavirus. H.R. 6666 — the COVID-19 Testing, Reaching, And Contacting Everyone Act would allow local clinics, hospitals, schools and nonprofits to apply for funding under a new grant program.  Soon after the legislation was introduced, people took to social media to discuss their interpretation and critics of the proposal.  A viral Facebook post from Shilamida Kupershteyn claimed contact tracing would allow the government to enter homes at any time and remove family members who had been exposed to the coronavirus. The post ultimately claimed ""contact tracing takes away all of your freedom."" USA TODAY has reached out to Kupershteyn for a comment, but hasn't received a response. Other similar claims about forced removal related to the TRACE Act have been made across Facebook.  According to the legislation and a statement from Rush's office, the bill would set aside $100 billion for ""community health centers, school based health centers, academic medical centers, non-profits, and other entities who would hire and train individuals to operate mobile testing units, as well as outreach in hot spots and medically underserved areas."" Recipients of funds would then have to use the money to buy testing equipment and personal protective gear and hire, train and pay members of the community to operate mobile testing units as well as door-to-door outreach. The legislation does not provide specifics on how grant recipients should conduct contact tracing procedures.  According to the statement, the objective of the bill — and contact tracing as a whole — is to figure out how COVID-19 is spreading through individual communities. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention states contact tracing is a ""key strategy"" for reducing further spread of COVID-19. During contact tracing, health staff works with patients to help identify everyone they may have come in contact with while they were potentially infectious. Public health staff then warns these individuals about their potential exposure, without revealing the identity of the original patient. They provide information and support to help the contacts understand the risk, monitor themselves and separate from others if necessary. The contacts are encouraged to stay home and social distance for 14 days, in order to prevent potentially furthering the spread of the virus. If contacts do become ill, they can notify the health staff so they can be tested and determine if medical care is necessary.  The CDC says, ""Immediate action is needed. Communities must scale up and train a large contact tracer workforce and work collaboratively across public and private agencies to stop the transmission of COVID-19."" Estimates for the number of contact tracers needed range from 100,000 to 300,000. Tens of thousands of Americans have applied for contact tracer roles, and over 11,000 contact tracers are working in the U.S. as of late April, according to NPR. Critics of the bill, including the author of the viral Facebook post mentioned above, appear to believe that the legislation would allow testing workers to forcibly enter homes and potentially take members of the household to ""safe houses.""  However, the bill states ""nothing in this section shall be construed to supersede any Federal privacy or confidentiality requirement.""  Meaning, the legislation will uphold the rights laid out in privacy protections, the Fourth Amendment right to privacy and the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. ""This bill does not authorize anyone to enter your home, for whatever reason, without your permission, nor does it allow the government to remove anyone from your home because of the coronavirus,"" Rush said in a statement on his website.  The claims in the post have been rated false. The bill's language explicitly states that the legislation would not supersede any existing privacy protections. All testing done by contact tracing groups would be voluntary, testing groups could not enter homes against the owner's wishes and members of the household would not be forcibly taken.  Thank you for supporting our journalism.

4,4,Tech privacy firm warns coronavirus contact tracing Care19 app violates policyStephen Groves ,"May 22, 2020",https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2020/05/22/covid-19-contact-tracing-app-care-19-privacy-policy/5247445002/,"SIOUX FALLS, S.D. – A contact tracing app pushed by the governors of North Dakota and South Dakota as a tool to trace exposure to the coronavirus violated its own privacy policy by sharing location and user identification information with third-party businesses, according to a report from a tech privacy company. The Care19 app, developed by ProudCrowd, of North Dakota, was one of the first contact tracing apps endorsed by state governments in response to the coronavirus. Governors from both states promoted it as a way to help health officials stop outbreaks and retrace the steps of people with infections, while assuring people that their data is protected. But tech privacy company Jumbo Privacy reported this week that developers included lines of code that send users' location and identification data to third-party companies including Foursquare, BugFender and Google. Contact tracing technology:Apple and Google release coronavirus contact tracing technology for public health mobile apps Apple Face ID fix:It just got a little easier to unlock your iPhone while wearing a face mask Concerned citizens have been eyeing the tradeoff between controlling outbreaks using apps and intrusions on privacy. Civil liberty groups and tech watchdogs have warned about contact tracing apps, saying governments and companies should not be able to access personal data. The Care19 app shared location data with Foursquare, an advertising company that markets to people based on their location. ProudCrowd CEO Tim Brookins said his company sends data to Foursquare to determine which businesses a user has visited, but the data is discarded and not used for commercial purposes. ""The simple overarching fact here is that we have stated, and Foursquare has confirmed, that they have not, nor will not, collect data from Care19 users. Period,"" Brookins said. The app generates an anonymous code for every user. The Jumbo Privacy report noted that the code, along with the phone's identification, was sent to BugFender, a Barcelona-based company that helps developers track malfunctions. The app also sent an advertising identifier linked with the user's phone to Google's Firebase service. That adds up to ""serious privacy risks,"" Jumbo said. ""It's really an oversight from them,"" said Jumbo Privacy CEO Pierre Valade. ""It's not a bad intention. They were rushing to build this product."" Until Friday, Care19's privacy statement told users their location data would ""not be shared with anyone, including government entities or third parties, unless you consent or ProudCrowd is compelled under federal regulations."" A revised statement says third parties ""may have temporary access to aspects of your data for their specific data processing tasks. However, they will not collect this data in a form that allows themselves or others to access or otherwise use this data."" South Dakota Secretary of Health Kim Malsam-Rysdon said the Care19 app doesn't violate the privacy statement and that users always had to grant permission for the app to use their data. The South Dakota version of the app has been downloaded more than 18,000 times, but hasn't been used to trace an active infection yet. ""This is a voluntary, opt-in app,"" she said. North Dakota Republican Gov. Doug Burgum said in a statement that the app, which has over 33,000 downloads in his state, does not use names, addresses or other personal information. ""The anonymous information Care19 is gathering can save lives, and smartly and safely using technology is one more way to help us speed up our economy recovery,"" he said."
5,5,Fact check: TRACE Act does not permit expanded government surveillanceMatthew Brown ,"May 29, 2020",https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2020/05/27/fact-check-trace-act-hr-6666-does-not-permit-expanded-surveillance/5228333002/,"Anxieties around the ability of government to monitor individuals have hit a flashpoint amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Claims circulating online contend that proposed legislation in Congress to fight the pandemic would allow for unprecedented mass surveillance in the United States. ""Unbelievably, House Bill 6666 has been introduced into the US Congress. Its name is COVID-19 Testing, Reaching And Contacting Everyone (TRACE) Act. This bill is a clear violation of our constitutional rights,"" reads a post on Facebook claiming that the TRACE Act will allow for individual government surveillance. ""If a digital patient identification number is implemented in the United States, then it would have far-reaching implications. It could easily replace your driver’s license and your social security number. It would give the government access to your medical records,"" the post continues. The TRACE Act would not allow for expanded government surveillance of individuals. Instead, the bill maintains existing federal privacy and confidentiality requirements.  Fact check: Under TRACE Act, cellphones will not be updated with ‘COVID-19 traceability' The Testing, Reaching, And Contacting Everyone Act is sponsored by Rep. Bobby Rush, D-Ill., and was introduced May 1. The main priority of the bill is to direct $100 billion in funding from the federal government to organizations around the country that conduct contact tracing work. The bill would also fund COVID-19 testing efforts at recipient organizations, as well as the purchasing of equipment for medical staff. Contact tracing is a public health practice in which the activities of an infected person are documented so that officials can track the spread of a disease. Contact tracing may take several forms; efforts to track the spread of COVID-19 have often involved interviewing exposed individuals, collecting documents and information as well as some digital mechanisms in development.  More:Apple and Google release coronavirus contact tracing technology for public health mobile apps The TRACE Act does not specify a role for the federal government in collecting or using information gathered in contact tracing efforts. Section 2(e) of the bill reads: ""Nothing in this section shall be construed to supersede any Federal privacy or confidentiality requirement,"" including regulations under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 or Public Health Service Act, which govern the privacy of medical records and federal powers to enact quarantines, respectively. The HIPAA Privacy Rule allows for health care providers to give protected information to ""to public health authorities who are legally authorized to receive such reports"" without a patient's authorization, ""for the purpose of preventing or controlling disease, injury, or disability."" The rule also provides for other disclosures in certain circumstances. On April 9, the Office of Civil Rights in HHS said it would use discretion in enforcement of HIPAA rules to ""help the growth of mobile testing sites so more people can get tested quickly and safely,"" for COVID-19, according to a press release. The notice is meant to allow for the faster sharing of COVID-19 data between testing facilities and ""Federal public health authorities and health oversight agencies, state and local health departments, and state emergency operations centers,"" according to a notice from the Director of the OCR at HHS. Neither the Privacy Rule nor the new HHS notice give the federal government new powers to collect additional information amid the coronavirus pandemic. The TRACE Act also does not grant any new powers. No part of the TRACE Act would make testing or quarantining mandatory. “The bill does not force you or your loved ones to do anything at all,” Rush said in a May 1 press release. The federal government’s ability to monitor residents has come under scrutiny as some argue the COVID-19 pandemic demands an invasion of privacy to protect public health. The legal and epidemiological aspects of the challenge have been investigated by various government agencies. The Congressional Research Service, which conducts research for congressional committees and offices, found that surveillance using “traditional methods” like public video cameras, likely wouldn’t violate the Fourth Amendment, which protects against “unreasonable searches and seizures.” The CRS also found that nonlocation-specific Bluetooth systems, like those being developed jointly by Apple and Google, are likely constitutional. Indeed, the CRS found ample legal precedent for Congress to increase surveillance in the face of an ongoing pandemic. It was less clear, however, how courts may react given the highly case-dependent nature of the subject. “Congress may not legislate away constitutional protections, and thus any legislative framework authorizing suspicionless searches would need to be sufficiently ‘calibrated’ to the ostensible special needs of disease detection and spread prevention,” the service also found. States around the country have either launched or are developing contact tracing apps to help track the spread of COVID-19. Because of potential privacy concerns posed by the first of these projects, Google and Apple banned GPS location data from contact tracing apps that rely on their technology. The move means that state governments are unlikely to heavily rely on technology-led contact tracing efforts, as were first rolled out in North and South Dakota, as well as Utah. Instead, governments are likely to use them as a supplement to human-led efforts, as seen in New York and Massachusetts. Congress has not proposed any legislation that would expand the federal government’s role in government surveillance to address the COVID-19 pandemic. “For surveillance of COVID-19, and the virus that causes it, SARS-COV-2, CDC is using multiple surveillance systems run in collaboration with state, local, territorial, and academic partners to monitor COVID-19 disease in the United States,” the CDC states on its website. The agency has sought to update its data collection systems to increase the accuracy of its statistics, but the system ultimately relies on reports from officials and practitioners around the country. The Department of Health and Human Services originally required that all COVID-19 testing be conducted by the CDC; it has since authorized other firms and organizations to test for the virus. The TRACE Act would expand funding for groups that conduct testing around the country but would not make it easier for the federal government to intervene in tracking individual cases. Fact check:Bill Gates did not craft contact tracing bill We rate this claim FALSE because it is not supported by our research. The TRACE Act is not a surveillance bill as the term is traditionally understood. The legislation would fund contact tracing efforts around the country, most of which would go toward private organizations. The bill creates no new surveillance powers on the part of the federal government and expressly provides that it does not ""supersede any Federal privacy or confidentiality requirement."" While Congress likely has some power to expand government surveillance amid a pandemic, it has not yet used this power. Thank you for supporting our journalism.

6,6,Fact check: Is TRACE Act's federal funding tied to refusing entry to unvaccinated?McKenzie Sadeghi ,"May 28, 2020",https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2020/05/27/fact-check-trace-acts-funding-tied-prohibiting-unvaccinated/5219417002/,"A bill focused on contact tracing that was introduced by an Illinois congressman has created a social media uproar and led to many false claims online. One post claimed facilities mentioned in the legislation will receive funding only if they ban nonvaccinated persons from their locations. Social media users quickly began sharing a popular meme on Facebook that was posted May 9. “Congress just introduced a bill. HR 6666,” the post reads. “It gives 100 billion dollars to schools, churches and medical buildings, the only way they can receive the money is to agree by contract that they will only allow people into their facilities that have the covid 19 vaccination, are tested and tracked. It’s on congress.gov. Awake yet!?” The claim was just one of many concerning the TRACE Act: Testing, Reaching and Contacting Everyone, which now is before  the House Committee on Energy and Commerce. Other false claims about the bill have already been debunked. Fact check:Bill Gates did not craft contact tracing bill The TRACE Act, introduced by Rep. Bobby Rush, D-Ill., on May 1, does allow for $100 billion in the form of grants to be given to eligible entities as described in the bill. They include federally qualified health centers, school-based health clinics, and ""disproportionate share"" hospitals, and nonprofit and academic medical centers. Other qualified grant recipients include high schools, institutions of higher education and “any other type of entity that is determined by the Secretary (of Health and Human Services) to be an eligible entity for purposes of this section,” according to the bill text. Related:Here's how new mobile apps could warn you of coronavirus exposure The grants given to the entities would be used to create mobile health units that would provide testing and providing individuals with services related to testing and quarantining at their homes. Funding would also be used to “hire, train, compensate, and pay the expenses of individuals … and to purchase personal protective equipment and other supplies.” Priority would be given to applicants in COVID-19 hot spots or facilities in medically undeserved communities, the bill says. The main purposes of the bill would be to fund contact tracing to combat the spread of the coronavirus and to provide more testing. “Given that many people with coronavirus are asymptomatic, contact tracing becomes even more important if we are serious about getting back to work and back to normal,” Rush said on his site. Related:US pledges up to $1.2 billion to access 300 million doses of experimental COVID-19 vaccine While there are testing and trials in the works to create a vaccination for COVID-19, the bill makes no mention of limiting funding to entities that require people be vaccinated against the virus before being granted access inside one of the facilities. No provisions in the legislation mention vaccination. In fact, the words “vaccine” and “vaccination” are not once used in the bill text. A vaccine for COVID-19 does not yet exist, making it impossible to require vaccinations before entering one of the facilities that would be funded by the bill. Rush said on his site that until a vaccine is readily available, “contact tracing in order to understand the full breadth and depth of the spread of this virus is the only way we will be able to get out from under this.” H.R. 6666 does propose $100 billion in funding in the form of grants for organizations such as health care centers, nonprofits and academic entities to create mobile testing sites and to hire and train staff to perform increased testing and engage in contact tracing to combat the spread of the coronavirus. However, the bill does not have any mention of a contract providing that facilities would be eligible for funding under the bill only if they agree to prohibit people who haven't received COVID-19 vaccines from entering their facilities. The text of the bill makes no mention of such a contract. There is no vaccine yet available for the virus, making such a provision impossible.

7,7,Apple and Google release coronavirus contact tracing technology for public health mobile appsJessica Guynn ,"May 20, 2020",https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2020/05/20/apple-and-google-release-coronavirus-contact-tracing-mobile-app-technology/5229556002/,"Apple and Google are releasing contact tracing technology to help public health officials develop mobile apps that can identify and test people who’ve spent time with or near someone infected with the coronavirus, the companies announced Wednesday. A number of U.S. states, including North Dakota and Alabama, and 22 countries have received access to the technology that was designed to help governments better track and contain the spread of the virus, the companies said. In a statement, North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum described the smartphone technology as being “critical to getting communities and economies back up and running.” Been exposed to the coronavirus?:Apple and Google will warn you. Here's how. Apple, Google team up on contact tracing:Public health apps using the tech could warn you of coronavirus exposure Mobile apps using the technology can track users who are in the vicinity of an infected person for at least five minutes and anonymously notify them. The apps will rely on Bluetooth technology, which is commonly used to link wireless speakers and keyboards.  By joining forces, Apple and Google have made it possible to use most smartphones to share information about possible exposure to the virus. But some research suggests that widespread adoption – by some estimates, 60% – is needed for mobile apps to be effective in helping to contain an outbreak. Nearly 3 in 5 Americans said they would be unwilling or unable to use Google and Apple's contact tracing technology, according to a Washington Post-University of Maryland poll. Some public health officials have been frustrated by rules set by Apple and Google that prevent them from harvesting the location, phone number and other personal details from users, though mobile apps can ask users to divulge that information. “User adoption is key to success and we believe that these strong privacy protections are also the best way to encourage use of these apps,” Apple and Google said in a statement. “Each user gets to decide whether or not to opt-in to exposure notifications; the system does not collect or use location from the device; and if a person is diagnosed with Covid-19, it is up to them whether or not to report that in the public health app.”"
8,8,"Fact check: H.R. 6666, the TRACE Act, would not force coronavirus-carriers into quarantineChelsey Cox ","May 28, 2020",https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2020/05/28/fact-check-trace-act-does-not-force-covid-19-carriers-into-quarantine/5191769002/,"Speculation about the proposed measures in House Resolution 6666 made the rounds on social media shortly after it was introduced this month. The claim that people who have been in contact with a person who tested positive for the coronavirus would be forced to quarantine appeared on Facebook. It was also mentioned in a Facebook livestream May 8 by Dr. Rashid Buttar. Other Facebook users have posted the same claim in discussing the impacts of the TRACE Act.  House Resolution 6666, also known as the COVID-19 Testing, Reaching and Contacting Everyone (TRACE) Act, is a bipartisan bill introduced by Rep. Bobby Rush, D-Ill., on May 1. It features a $100 billion grant program for health and medical centers, nonprofit groups and other health care service providers to establish mobilized coronavirus testing units and train staff in contract tracing. Contact tracing is the practice of tracking down and alerting people an infected individual came in contact with, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  Fact check:Bill Gates did not craft contact tracing bill ""They're going to use that to pull you or your loved ones – especially your children – away under pretense of public safety,"" North Carolina physician Buttar said of routine testing. Buttar claimed the legislation would allow ""people"" to come into your home if you had symptoms and tested positive for COVID-19. He said children would be removed from parents who tested positive, or authorities would take ""your grandmother or your father or you and put you into quarantine."" Buttar has touted the idea that the flu vaccine can trigger a false positive for coronavirus, but this is false. More:States are reopening, but many require travelers to self-quarantine. Here's where Section 2 describe's the legislation's purpose: ""The Secretary of Health and Human Services, acting through the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, may award grants to eligible entities to conduct diagnostic testing for COVID–19, to trace and monitor the contacts of infected individuals, and to support the quarantine of such contacts."" The bill's text does not state or imply that the government will put people in quarantine or remove members of households to put them into quarantine.  ""This bill does not authorize anyone to enter your home, for whatever reason, without your permission, nor does it allow the government to remove anyone from your home because of the coronavirus,"" according to a news release from Rush's office. Instead, mobile testing units would service people without access to a testing center or those unable to leave their homes. Testing would be ""completely voluntary,"" according to the news release.   ""The bill does not force you or your loved ones to do anything at all. With that being said, if you or a loved one does have  the coronavirus, it is advised that you do self-quarantine and maintain social distance from others,"" the statement said. We rate this claim FALSE because it is not supported by our research. The TRACE Act proposes awarding grant money to health care entities to expand coronavirus testing and contact tracing. Testing is not mandatory, and contact tracing would serve to alert people who might have been in contact with someone infected with the coronavirus. Thank you for supporting our journalism.

9,9,Apple and Google join forces on tech for app that could warn you of coronavirus exposureGeorge Petras and Jennifer Borresen ,"May 26, 2020",https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/news/2020/04/28/contract-tracing-app-could-warn-you-of-coronavirus-exposure/5163841002/,"Your smartphone may soon be telling you that you've been close to someone infected by the coronavirus and that you may need to isolate yourself. Apple and Google are offering a mobile software tool that will let iPhones and Android devices talk to each other and allow digital contact tracing, which tracks those with infections and alerts others who have been in close contact. Apple and Google announced May 21 that they've released an API, or application programming interface, that helps a smartphone anonymously detect when it's been near the smartphone of someone who has reported they have the virus. That API will let software developers build apps — distributed by public health authorities — that could alert users to potential exposures to COVID-19. A number of U.S. states and 22 countries were given access to the API. Digital contact tracing doesn't diagnose infections; it only tells users if they've encountered someone who is infected. While other companies are building contact tracing apps, the Apple/Google partnership could greatly expand tracing, since: After the Apple/Google API is part of health department apps, the program will be ready for use. Phase 1, described below, involves downloading an app; in Phase II, with implementation yet to be determined, the tech will be part of iOS and Android devices. 1) Smartphone users voluntarily download a health department app from the internet. The apps will be supported on iOS devices introduced within the last four years, and Androids with Android 6.0 (introduced in 2015.) 2) The downloaded app makes use of the phone’s Bluetooth Low Energy beacon, which uses short-range radio waves to broadcast an anonymous, random code to nearby portable devices equipped with the same software. To preserve anonymity, the codes change every 10 to 20 minutes. 3) The Bluetooth Low Energy range of most smartphones is about 30 feet. The range can be less if the phone is inside a jacket pocket or purse. When users are mingling in public for five minutes or more, their devices automatically exchange codes and store them for 14 days, the length of the coronavirus incubation period. Distance between phones is calculated on signal strength. Codes are deleted after that. 4) If users learn they have COVID-19, they can voluntarily decide to alert other users with the health authority app. The health authority verifies their diagnoses and sends their codes, called diagnosis keys, to a cloud-based database. 5) Once a day, the database sends a list of diagnosis keys to phones. Keys are analyzed to see if they match any codes collected during the past 14 days. Physical locations and phone owners are not identified. 6) If a match is found, the local public health authority uses its app to alert users that they've been exposed to the virus and advises them how to proceed. Public health authorities have used contact tracing for years. Tracers interview infected people, learn who they've been in contact with, and advise them on what to do. Digital versions give contact tracing extra muscle by increasing its reach and speed. Detailed tracking of COVID-19 numbers has spurred hopes of more quickly lifting social restrictions – and tamping down a new outbreak once constraints are eased. Contact tracing is ""a key strategy for preventing further spread of COVID-19,"" according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It's a labor-intensive process, complicated by the lack of trained personnel. Politico reported health departments had less than 2,000 before the coronavirus reached the U.S. Now, as many as 300,000 tracers are needed, a former CDC director told STAT. But the rapid spread of COVID-19 means traditional tracing methods can be too slow. Even with the best of reporting, data accuracy depends on the memory of those being interviewed, which can be incomplete. Since the app collects and uploads information automatically, digital contact tracing proponents say it will be faster and more efficient. A report in Science estimates apps could ""replace a week's worth of manual contact tracing with instantaneous signals."" Other nations are already using similar digital technology, with varying degrees of severity. Singapore introduced Trace Together in March and China has ordered its citizens to use a Quick Response code on their smartphones. That program rates users' infection risk and decides where they are permitted to travel. Use of apps is voluntary and the effectiveness depends on the number of people downloading them, how they use them, and how they follow through. That means: Researchers at the University of Oxford say a minimum number of users must be committed to app use. Using simulations based on United Kingdom cities, researchers calculated that 56% of the UK's population would need to use the app, for it to be effective in curbing the pandemic. However, ""even with lower numbers of app users, we still estimate a reduction in the number of coronavirus cases and deaths,"" the April 16 report said. The need for widespread digital contact tracing has raised concerns over possible invasion of privacy, including identification and location, and loss of personal medical information. In a March 19 letter to the U.S. Office of Science and Technology Policy, Sen. Edward Markey, D-Mass., urged policymakers to ""balance privacy with any data-driven solutions to the current public health crisis."" In a similar vein, the Center for American Progress released recommendations for digital tracing while the European Commission recommended a list of anti-theft checks and balances for all tracking apps used against the pandemic. Both Google and Apple say they've taken precautions to anonymize tracking data. Google says access is granted only to public health authorities whose apps have to meet standards for privacy, security and data control. Those who test positive are not identified to other users or Google or Apple. Apple told USA TODAY that use is strictly voluntary, locations aren't collected, and that the system is used only for exposure notification and isn't monetized. The broadcast system can be disabled on a regional basis after it's no longer needed, or users can simply turn them off by uninstalling the tracing application. The companies say health department apps will be reviewed before being connected. Apple said it's offered to work with regional health departments to strengthen security of their apps.

Montgomery Mayor Steven Reed said he called a news conference to reveal the sobering situation at the urging of overwhelmed area doctors and with the Memorial Day weekend ahead. “Many people in Montgomery hospitals are not from Montgomery,” Reed said. “They’re suffering because they don’t have the rural health care system in place that they need. Right now, if you’re from Montgomery, and you need an ICU bed, you’re in trouble. If you’re from central Alabama, and you need an ICU bed, you may not be able to get one.” The days ahead are crucial, city Emergency Management Agency Director Christina Thornton said. She pleaded with people to be kind to front-line workers while staying home as much as possible. “This isn’t the time to have big block parties,” Thornton said. Juneau: The Legislature adjourned Wednesday after the Senate gave final approval to plans for using more than $1 billion in federal coronavirus relief aid. The House adjourned Tuesday after passing a ratification bill, and though the Senate passed an identical bill Tuesday, it still needed to consider the House-passed version to finalize matters. Lawmakers were spurred by a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the plans. Gov. Mike Dunleavy submitted plans to the Legislative Budget and Audit Committee through a process that allows a governor to submit plans to accept and spend additional federal or other program funds on a budget item. The committee agreed to more than $1 billion in plans despite concerns that some of the items fell outside the scope of what can go through that committee process. Phoenix: Gov. Doug Ducey said Wednesday that people in the state are acting responsibly since he loosened restrictions on businesses, but he’s not ready yet to open new sectors of the economy. Ducey said he has an “aspirational” goal for schools to reopen on schedule in August, and he’s hopeful summer camps and youth activities will be open soon. Schools have been closed since March, when Ducey and schools chief Kathy Hoffman shut them due to staffing concerns stemming from the coronavirus outbreak. Hoffman has formed a task force of education leaders to write plans for the safe reopening of schools. The Republican governor said he sees “zero evidence” that Arizona will have a surge in coronavirus infections as social distancing measures relax. But he suggested he’s willing to reimpose restrictions if necessary. “I am going to use every tool that’s available to a governor to do what’s in the best interest of Arizona,” Ducey said. Little Rock: Although many high school seniors are missing out on traditional graduation ceremonies because of the coronavirus pandemic this spring, the virtual sendoff for some Little Rock high schoolers will include words of encouragement from a former president. Bill Clinton, who served as Arkansas governor for 12 years before he was elected president, recorded speeches for the graduating classes at J.A. Fair, Parkview Magnet, Hall, John L. McClellan and Central high schools, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reports. He encouraged them to look toward the future with optimism and said the COVID-19 outbreak has reinforced the importance of people unifying despite tough circumstances. “We need each other. When there is a challenge, run toward it; don’t run away from it,” he told Fair High’s graduates, whose ceremony was the first broadcast on various websites and platforms Tuesday night. The initial showing of the Hall graduation followed Fair’s ceremony. Sacramento: More than 1,200 pastors say they will resume in-person services May 31 in defiance of Gov. Gavin Newsom’s stay-at-home order to slow the spread of the new coronavirus. Newsom has gradually allowed some businesses to reopen as the state’s number of virus-related hospitalizations has flattened. But churches are still banned, along with hair salons and sporting events. Newsom said Monday that churches could reopen in weeks, not months. But many churches are tired of waiting. Wednesday, a lawyer representing a church in Lodi that has sued Newsom said more than 1,200 pastors have signed a “declaration of essentiality” that announces their plan to reopen while observing physical distancing and other precautions. Attorney Robert Tyler said some pastors represent multiple churches. He expects as many as 3,000 churches across California could have in-person services May 31. Denver: Gov. Jared Polis and state health officials urged residents to celebrate the Memorial Day weekend responsibly by sticking to existing social distancing restrictions, wearing masks, and staying in groups of 10 or fewer people to fight the coronavirus pandemic. “This isn’t exactly a normal Memorial Day weekend. It’s a Memorial Day weekend in the middle of a worldwide pandemic,” Polis said. “It’s not the time for big family reunions and massive cookouts and celebrations” but about “solemnly honoring the fallen.” Colorado has reopened campgrounds and transitioned from a stay-at-home to “safer-at-home” directive that has eased restrictions on retail businesses while urging residents to limit travel. It has flattened the growth curve of the virus and guaranteed there are enough intensive care beds at hospitals to treat the sick. But that progress can easily be undone, said Jill Hunsaker Ryan, executive director of the Department of Public Health and Environment. Colorado, Ryan said, is “a victim of our own success” in flattening that curve. “But we are not out of the woods,” she said. “The disease can easily get away from us.” Hartford: The state’s two federally recognized tribes on Wednesday announced plans to begin reopening portions of their sprawling Foxwoods Resort Casino and Mohegan Sun attractions June 1, despite calls from Gov. Ned Lamont to remain shuttered to prevent another wave of infections from the coronavirus. The Democratic governor said it’s “too early and dangerous” to reopen the casinos, and he hopes to persuade the sovereign nations to hold off in order to protect their employees, patrons and the greater community. But when pressed, Lamont said Connecticut has “a number of options,” including talking to unions that represent some of the casino workers about the potential dangers and warning casino patrons. Mohegan Tribal Chairman James Gessner said the tribes’ plan makes it clear they’ll advise older customers to take specific precautions and to stay home if they are part of an at-risk group. Dover: The number of initial unemployment claims filed by Delawareans ticked up slightly last week even as businesses begin to prepare for a gradual reopening of the state’s economy amid the coronavirus epidemic. The Delaware Department of Labor reported Thursday that just under 5,600 initial unemployment claims were filed for the week ending May 16. That’s up from about 5,200 the previous week and the first increase in seven weeks. Officials said almost 96,000 jobless claims have been filed since March 15 and more than $234.7 million in unemployment benefits paid. That total includes $142 million in federal funds and almost $92 million from Delaware’s unemployment insurance trust fund. Gov. John Carney has already loosened some restrictions on economic activity under pressure from the business, tourism and agricultural communities but has kept others in place, including a ban on hotel room and beach home rentals. The official first phase of a gradual reopening of the state’s economy is to begin June 1. Washington: Some D.C. students could head back to school as early as Aug. 10, according to members of the ReOpen DC Committee on Education and Childcare. That’s about two weeks earlier than normal, WUSA-TV reports. D.C. officials offered the earlier return as one possibility as they consider how and when to safely return students to the classroom. Three possible options for return have been confirmed with several school principals: an extension of the distance learning model for as long as two months, alternating groups of students every other day based on need and grade, and a socially distant classroom model with 10 students sitting 6 feet apart. Orlando: The number of Floridians who filed new unemployment claims last week remained almost unchanged from the previous week, suggesting some stabilization in job losses as businesses have started reopening after being closed to stop the spread of the new coronavirus, according to labor figures released Thursday. The U.S. Department of Labor reported Floridians filed 223,927 jobless claims last week, compared to 223,082 claims filed in the previous week. Only California and New York had more new claims filed last week. The Florida Department of Economic Opportunity has received more than 2 million claims seeking unemployment benefits from Floridians, though only 1.6 million claims have been verified. Just under 1 million jobless workers in Florida have been paid more than $2.6 billion in benefits. Florida’s workforce before pandemic-related business closures stood at 10 million workers. Atlanta: The state set a new all-time high for unemployment in April, with the jobless rate rising to 11.9% as waves of workers lost their jobs due to COVID-19. The state only in February hit an all-time low of 3.1% unemployment and now has surpassed its previous all-time high of 10.6% set in December 2010. The jobless rate had begun to climb in March as the first effects of coronavirus related shutdowns showed up, rising to 4.2%. The number of Georgians in the labor force fell from almost 5.2 million in March to less than 4.9 million in April, as many people gave up looking for work. The U.S. Department of Labor has said the actual unemployment rate may be higher because some people who have been furloughed are answering survey questions as if they’re still getting a regular paycheck. Honolulu: A newly formed policy group has announced an effort to reboot the state’s tourism-based economy following the coronavirus outbreak using Native Hawaiian cultural values. The Aina Aloha Economic Futures Declaration sent to Democratic Gov. David Ige seeks to create an economy based on centuries of island-based values, The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. The group’s organizers seek input from community members to urge decision-makers to create a new economic road map for the state. The declaration was authored by 14 community members who want “to reboot the entire operating system of our economy,” said Kamanamaikalani Beamer, associate professor at the University of Hawaii’s Center for Hawaiian Studies. A new, post-coronavirus economy for Hawaii needs to be based on values “that have sustained life in these islands for centuries,” Beamer said. Before the pandemic, Hawaii faced another year of “10 million people marching across our land,” said Joseph Lapilio, president of the Native Hawaiian Chamber of Commerce. Boise: State election officials botched the mail-in primary process, says a Republican candidate for Congress who has filed a federal lawsuit seeking to extend the deadline for requesting a ballot until next week. Nicholas Jones in the lawsuit filed Tuesday said the secretary of state’s website became overwhelmed and failed to meet the demand for ballot requests as the 8 p.m. Tuesday deadline loomed, denying some people their only opportunity to prepare to vote. In the lawsuit filed against Idaho Secretary of State Lawerence Denney, Jones asks for the deadline to be extended until 8 p.m. next Tuesday. Jones, who owns several board game shops and burger eateries, is challenging first-term Republican U.S. Rep. Russ Fulcher. Idaho shifted to its first-ever entirely mail-in primary this year because of the coronavirus pandemic. Elections officials said they couldn’t secure in-person voting venues or enough volunteers. Springfield: Legislators approved extraordinary safety rules Wednesday as they convened for the first time in 10 weeks due to the coronavirus pandemic, prompting the highly unusual step of removing a Republican from the House floor when he refused to wear a face mask. Rep. Jim Durkin, the House GOP leader, called on members to approve and follow an emergency House rule requiring members to wear masks, saying it’s important to protect members’ families, as well as each other and legislative and convention center staff. Among the “no” votes was GOP Rep. Darren Bailey of Xenia, who has said he’s speaking on behalf of residents who feel “captive” and “burdened” by state-ordered restrictions on movement. Moments before he was escorted out after refusing to comply, Bailey voted against the face-covering requirement. “The representative has shown callous disregard for life, callous disregard for people’s health,” Gov. J.B. Pritzker said later at his daily COVID-19 briefing. “Clearly, the representative has no interest in protecting others.” Indianapolis: The state’s coronavirus restrictions will ease in parts of the state Friday, two days ahead of schedule, to allow for more activity over the Memorial Day weekend, the governor said Wednesday. The state health department reported 38 more coronavirus deaths, raising the state’s death toll from confirmed or presumed cases of COVID-19 to 1,864. A new state order will allow social gatherings of up to 100 people and retail stores and malls to operate at 75% capacity, Gov. Eric Holcomb said. Gatherings have been limited to 25 people and stores to 50% capacity under the state’s first easing of restrictions that took effect May 4. Gyms, fitness centers, community pools and campgrounds will also be allowed to open under rules limiting the number of people and for distancing and cleaning. Holcomb pointed to a decline in the number of COVID-19-infected people hospitalized and the continued availability of intensive care unit beds to treat those most seriously ill. “We’ve earned the ability, I should say, the ability to continue to move forward,” Holcomb said. Cedar Rapids: A top health emergency response official in eastern Iowa told Gov. Kim Reynolds’ administration this week that local officials struggled to get basic data from the Test Iowa coronavirus testing site in Cedar Rapids, which made it difficult to make smart public health decisions. In an email sent to key Reynolds deputies, Tricia Kitzmann, the incident commander for Linn County Public Health’s COVID-19 response, included the subject line: “Test Iowa Concerns.” It presented a dire portrait of communication between the governor’s office and officials representing one of Iowa’s largest counties. Kitzmann said she was concerned about the “lag time” between testing at the Test Iowa Cedar Rapids site and results being sent to officials; the lack of county-specific information about how many people were qualified to be tested and how many had received negative test results; and the “high” number of inconclusive test results. “When we receive timely results, we begin contact tracing and isolation measures to mitigate spread of the infection,” she wrote. “Due to the lag time between testing and results, we are delayed in our response.” Topeka: The state softened its quarantine guidelines for meatpacking plants after industry executives repeatedly pushed state officials to allow employees who were potentially exposed to the coronavirus to keep working, text messages and emails show. The Kansas City Star and The Wichita Eagle report they obtained messages through an open records request showing that executives at Tyson and National Beef pushed Kansas Secretary of Agriculture Mike Beam to advocate more-lenient federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidance. Beam told the Associated Press on Wednesday that his role was to “emphasize internally” in Gov. Laura Kelly’s administration that there would be major problems with the nation’s food supply if the plants shut down. Beam worked for the Kansas Livestock Association for 38 years before becoming agriculture secretary in 2019. “It was a balancing act, and I basically was feeding that into the mix,” he said. Frankfort: Looking to deflate resistance to wearing masks, Gov. Andy Beshear on Wednesday called it “basic public health guidance” to combat the coronavirus that shouldn’t spark political divisions. Beshear starts his daily televised briefings by removing his mask before starting to speak. He donned his mask again when stepping away from the podium to allow someone else to speak. He called it an extension of practicing his religious belief in looking out for one’s neighbors. Beshear also invoked the science behind wearing masks in public amid the global pandemic. “Every scientist out there says that this helps us protect our neighbor,” the governor said. “It is a choice to protect your neighbor. It’s also a choice not to.” At a gas station and convenience store in Manchester, a “no face masks allowed” sign was posted at the front of the store, the Lexington Herald-Leader reports, citing social media posts. After the sign drew complaints, the eastern Kentucky store responded that it was a joke. “We wear face mask, but we dont require our customers to, its their choice,” the store said in a comment. Baton Rouge: The number of COVID-19 patients in hospitals in the state has dropped below 1,000 for the first time since late March. “Just over a month ago, we had 2,134 individuals in the hospital from COVID-19,” and Wednesday’s number was 931, Gov. John Bel Edwards said on his monthly call-in radio show. Louisiana Department of Hospitals data shows 927 were hospitalized March 28, and the figure jumped to 1,032 the next day, with the peak Edwards noted April 13. The 110 patients on ventilators Wednesday was the lowest since March 25 – the second day for which the state coronavirus website shows such reports. It showed 94 patients needing mechanical help to breathe March 24 and 163 on March 25. The number of ventilated patients peaked nine days before hospitalizations, at 571 on April 4. Edwards eased pandemic restraints on some businesses Friday and noted it takes a week or two to see whether the increased movement has increased the number of cases. Windham: The state Department of Corrections says it doesn’t intend to expand coronavirus testing beyond the Maine Correctional Center in Windham. So far, there have been no additional positive tests after an inmate at the prison fell ill with COVID-19 on Sunday. As of Wednesday, 148 samples from inmates and staff had been tested, and another 39 were pending. More samples will be taken from additional staff and inmates Thursday and Friday, officials said. Health officials worked to determine who had come into contact with the individual in recent days, and test results will guide further steps to prevent the spread of the virus, said Corrections Commissioner Randall Liberty. Over the past several months, the Department of Corrections has taken steps to deal with the pandemic with enhanced cleaning measures and the suspension of all visits from family and friends. Baltimore: All large public events in the city have been canceled through Aug. 31, including the Fourth of July fireworks and the Artscape festival, officials announced Wednesday. Mayor Bernard C. “Jack” Young made the announcement as the city continues to battle the spread of the coronavirus, The Baltimore Sun reports. The city is still under a stay-at-home order issued in March in response to the pandemic. Baltimore is one of the largest cities in the U.S. to officially call off its July Fourth celebration. Asked if he would reconsider the move should conditions improve before July, Young said he couldn’t rule it out. “It’s always a possibility to take a second look at something, and I am open to that. But I will also be guided by our health professionals and the data they provide to tell us whether it’s safe to do that,” he said. Boston: The New England Patriots and the New England Revolution are planting a flag garden near Gillette Stadium to honor some of the state’s residents who have died in the service of the nation. The Massachusetts Military Heroes Fund usually plants about 37,000 U.S. flags on the Boston Common every Memorial Day to honor state residents who have died in wartime dating to the Revolutionary War, but this year’s event was canceled because of the coronavirus pandemic. The organization instead asked people to plant flags on their lawns or post flags in their windows. The Patriots’ and Revolution’s foundations in response planned to gather volunteers Thursday to plant more than 2,500 flags to honor the men and women from Foxborough who have lost their lives defending the country. The flag garden will remain on display through May 28. Social distancing will be enforced during the planting process. Lansing: Gov. Gretchen Whitmer on Thursday further relaxed stay-at-home restrictions, lifting a ban on nonessential health procedures late next week and letting residents immediately gather socially in small groups before the Memorial Day weekend. Retail businesses can reopen by appointment only, starting Tuesday, as long as there are no more than 10 customers inside at a time. People are required to continue adhering to social distancing. Her new stay-home order, which remains in effect through May 28, will likely be extended, she said. “This will not look like business as usual, although it will start to look at little more normal,” Whitmer said in a news conference. Restaurants, except in northern Michigan, will remain closed to dine-in customers. The closure of places of public accommodation such as casinos, gyms and hair salons remains in effect statewide. The state has reported 5,060 confirmed deaths due to coronavirus complications, fourth-most in the U.S. Minneapolis: The Minnesota Catholic Conference and the Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod say they plan to hold services next week despite a ban on in-person worship of more than 10 people. The two denominations sent Gov. Tim Walz separate letters this week to tell him they plan to open their doors to worship Tuesday, May 26. Some politicians and business leaders say Walz has not done enough to get the state back on track amid the coronavirus outbreak. Walz on Wednesday permitted restaurants and bars to reopen June 1 for outdoor dining with social distancing and other safeguards, while salons can resume cutting hair at partial capacity. It drew sharp criticism from those who had hoped for faster steps to help struggling businesses. The churches said their reopening plans come after “weeks of dialogue” with the governor, and they will resume services at 33% capacity Tuesday with Pentecost the following Sunday, the Star Tribune reports. Jackson: Some casinos in the state reopened Thursday for the first time in two months, following state guidelines to try to mitigate the spread of the new coronavirus. At least three dozen people stood in line waiting to get into WaterView Casino in Vicksburg as it opened. A manager came outside to do a countdown until opening. Customers were allowed to enter one at a time. They were screened for COVID-19 symptoms and offered masks, although many already had their own. Notes were attached to video games and slot machines, reminding customers and staff to sanitize the machines before each use. Stickers were placed on the floor to tell people to remain at least 6 feet apart. Plastic shields have been installed around cashiers’ stations. The state Gaming Commission limits the numbers of players for blackjack and other table games. Casinos are required to set up hand sanitizing stations. O’Fallon: The Missouri Chamber of Commerce on Wednesday urged Gov. Mike Parson to call a special session so lawmakers can take action to protect businesses from coronavirus-related lawsuits. In a letter to the Republican governor, the chamber called coronavirus liability an “emerging problem in Missouri.” The organization cited lawsuits filed by those who believe they contracted COVID-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus, on the premises of a business. The chamber said under current state law, the lawsuits can move forward regardless of whether businesses were taking precautions aimed at limiting the spread of the coronavirus. Chamber President Daniel P. Mehan said companies “that are making a good faith effort and taking the necessary precautions should not face crippling COVID-19 litigation.” Parson, during his afternoon news conference, said any special session would need to involve multiple issues. But he also expressed concerns about coronavirus-related lawsuits. “We’re not going to let attorneys go out here and sue everybody because they were doing their jobs,” Parson said. Helena: Armed demonstrators were among a group gathered at the Montana Capitol on Wednesday to protest the state government’s response to the coronavirus. About 60 protesters convened outside the Capitol building in Helena, The Independent Record reports. Some demonstrators carried guns, and others held signs, including many that referenced Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock. The governor enacted travel restrictions and a stay-at-home order March 28 in response to the spread of COVID-19. Bullock lifted the stay-at-home order for individuals April 26 and for many nonessential businesses April 27 as part of a phased reopening plan, while keeping some social distancing requirements in place. Omaha: Gov. Pete Ricketts said Wednesday that he’s “very pleased” with a coronavirus testing program established by out-of-state contractors, despite uncertainty that it will meet a goal of 3,000 tests per day by the month’s end. Nebraska announced the $27 million, no-bid contract with Utah-based Nomi Health and other firms April 21. They hoped to hit the testing target within five weeks. TestNebraska conducted just 1,197 tests Tuesday, said Dr. Gary Anthone, the state’s chief medical officer. That’s an increase since the beginning of May, when the program was averaging about 337 tests per day. With just 12 days left until month’s end, Ricketts has said he still believes the program will reach its goal “at some point,” but he backed away from earlier stated goals. “We’re pushing the team hard to get that done by the end of the month, but a lot of that will depend on people signing up,” he said at a news conference. Ricketts said the problem stems in part from residents who qualify for a test after filling out an online questionnaire but don’t show up as scheduled. As many as 15% of the people who are deemed eligible are no-shows, he said. Las Vegas: Signs of change with a gambling theme will greet tourists and employees when traveling ramps up following closures due to the coronavirus pandemic, McCarran International Airport officials said Wednesday. “We’re Doubling Down on Cleaning and Sanitizing,” says one of 10 advertisements that Clark County Aviation Director Rosemary Vassiliadis said the facility is using on signs, digital boards, audio messages, social media and its website. “Don’t Roll the Dice: Stay 6 (feet) Apart!” and “Hand Hygiene? Bet On It!” are other messages that officials hope will catch the eyes and ears of travelers while stemming the spread of the virus causing COVID-19. Another advises that only ticketed travelers and employees should enter airport terminals, and passengers will be urged to wear masks. Concord: The state is adding new coronavirus testing sites while taking away some of the eligibility restrictions. Testing facilities will open in Londonderry and Keene on Sunday, bringing the total number of state-operated sites to nine, Republican Gov. Chris Sununu said Wednesday. Currently, anyone with at least one symptom can get tested, as can asymptomatic health care workers, those over age 60 and people with underlying health conditions. Starting next week, that group will be expanded to include child care workers and those living in the same household with members of the vulnerable populations, said Health and Human Services Commissioner Lori Shibinette. Meanwhile, New Hampshire health clinics are getting nearly $700,000 to expand testing in rural communities. Fourteen clinics in New Hampshire will receive the funding from the federal Department of Health and Human Services. Bellmawr: Health officials have shuttered a gym in southern New Jersey that reopened this week in defiance of a state order that shut down nonessential businesses to help stem the spread of the coronavirus. Orange stickers from the Camden County Health Department declaring an embargo and a four-page notice from the state Department of Health were found Thursday taped to the door of the Atilis Gym in Bellmawr. The gym’s owners said the signs were placed on the storefront overnight. The gym reopened Monday and had continued daily operations, receiving summonses each day for violating the state order. Ian Smith, a co-owner of the gym, told WTXF-TV in Philadelphia that he and partner Frank Trumbetti plan on “dealing” with the notices and reopening Friday. Smith said the gym could have opened Thursday, but they did not want to violate the health department’s order. Santa Fe: Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham set a June 1 target date to restart dine-in service at restaurants and reopen gyms, hair salons and shopping malls at limited capacity. Those businesses have been shuttered since March to slow the spread of the coronavirus. The first-term Democratic governor and two Cabinet secretaries on health issues said Wednesday that a seven-day average of daily infections appears to have peaked around the start of the May and that progress has been made on several fronts toward meeting the state’s so-called gating criteria for reopening the economy. In an online news videoconference, they also cited an expansion in the number of daily tests to about 4,400 and complimented state residents for largely embracing a requirement that face masks be worn in public. New York: The state is now allowing religious gatherings of up to 10 people as hospitalization rates continue to decline, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said. Those small religious gatherings will be allowed statewide as long as participants wear masks and practice social distancing. The state also is allowing drive-in and parking lot services. Weddings will count as religious ceremonies. The state will work with an Interfaith Advisory Council to discuss proposals to safely bring back religious services. The council consists of dozens of religious leaders, including Cardinal Timothy Dolan and Rev. Dr. Calvin Butts. “I understand their desire to get to religious ceremonies as soon as possible. As a former altar boy, I get it,” Cuomo said. “But we need to find out how to do it and do it safely and do it smartly. The last thing we want to do is have a religious ceremony that winds up having more people infected.” Wilkesboro: Meat producer Tyson Foods is reporting 570 cases of COVID-19 at a poultry processing complex. Tyson said in a news release that it tested more than 2,000 staff members and contractors who work at its facility in Wilkesboro. Tyson said most of the 570 didn’t show symptoms. Tyson said it’s increasing testing and health care options at 30 of its facilities. Tyson said it’s also providing face masks, putting physical barriers between work stations and implementing social distancing practices. “We are working closely with local health departments to protect our team members and their families, and to help manage the spread of the virus in our communities,” Tom Brower, a Tyson health and safety executive, said in a statement. Tyson had temporarily closed parts of the North Carolina complex that houses multiple plants for deep cleaning, including a multiday closure announced last week. Bismarck: State health officials reported a single-day high of 134 positive COVID-19 cases Thursday and two more deaths. Statewide, there were 2,229 confirmed cases of the coronavirus as of Thursday. Cass County, which remains the epicenter of the state’s coronavirus outbreak, had 93 cases, bringing the county’s total to 1,370. The two deaths reported Thursday bring the statewide total to 51. Health officials said the victims were Cass County men in their 70s and 90s with underlying health conditions. Officials said 74,760 people have been tested for the coronavirus in North Dakota, up 2,757 from Wednesday. Health officials say 59,050 people so far have tested negative for the virus. Thirty-nine people are currently hospitalized with the virus, up one since Wednesday. The actual number of infections is thought to be far higher because many people have not been tested, and studies suggest people can be infected without feeling sick. Columbus: Nursing home residents continue to make up the vast majority of coronavirus-related deaths in the state, according to new Department of Health statistics. At least 1,246 residents of Ohio’s long-term care facilities have died as of Wednesday from the virus, or nearly 70% of the total COVID-19 deaths statewide, show the latest data, which arrived as Ohio was hit with both good and bad news. This year’s Ohio State Fair, scheduled in July and August, was canceled Thursday to help prevent the spread of the coronavirus. But Thursday also marked the day when indoor restaurant dining restarted, along with staying at campgrounds. Lt. Gov. Jon Husted also announced training for all sports, including contact sports like football, can resume May 26. Wedding receptions are now allowed again as well, with limits of 300 people and subject to the same social distancing rules governing bars and restaurants. Oklahoma City: The Oklahoma Department of Corrections is taking custody of healthy inmates from one county jail that reported it was ill-equipped to deal with the coronavirus pandemic, officials said. Inmates at the Comanche County Detention Center who have two consecutive negative coronavirus tests began being moved to state facilities Wednesday, the department said in a statement. County inmates who have tested positive for the virus remain quarantined at the jail in Lawton, about 80 miles southwest of Oklahoma City. Male inmates were taken to a state facility in Sayre, about 85 miles away, while female inmates were taken to McLoud, abut 95 miles away, where they will remain until at least June 1. The state plans to take 180-190 inmates, according to Johnny Owens, chair of the Comanche County Facilities Authority that oversees the jail. Salem: Restaurants, bars, salons, gyms and other businesses in Marion and Polk counties have been approved to reopen starting Friday with strict safety measures meant to halt the spread of the coronavirus. Gov. Kate Brown on Wednesday approved a plan for easing of restrictions that allows some businesses and services to operate while keeping sanitation, physical distancing, face covering and crowd size measures in place. The counties are required to remain in the first phase for at least 21 days and can only advance to more advanced phases if public health monitoring indicates it is safe. The later phases of the plan allow for increased gathering sizes and resumption of nonessential travel, nursing home and hospital visits, and additional seating at restaurants, bars and other venues. Only three counties have not had applications approved for the first phase. Clackamas County is awaiting approval, while Washington and Multnomah counties have not yet submitted their plans. Harrisburg: The state Department of Health on Thursday reported 102 additional deaths linked to COVID-19, raising the statewide total to 4,869. Two-thirds of the state’s deaths have been among residents of nursing homes and other facilities that care for older adults. State health officials also reported that 980 more people have tested positive for the new coronavirus. The state has recorded fewer than 1,000 new cases for 11 consecutive days. Since early March, infections have been confirmed in more than 65,000 people in Pennsylvania. The number of infections is thought to be far higher than the state’s confirmed case count because many people have not been tested, and studies suggest people can be infected without feeling sick. There is no data on how many people have fully recovered. With the number of new infections slowing, Gov. Tom Wolf has been easing social distancing restrictions and allowing many businesses to reopen in lightly impacted areas of the state. Providence: Oscar-winning actor Viola Davis partnered with the Frontline Foods nonprofit to sponsor 100 meals for staff at two hospitals helping in the state’s fight against the coronavirus. Davis, who grew up in Central Falls, was joined by members of the cast of “How to Get Away With Murder,” which stars Davis, in sponsoring the meals Wednesday from South Kingstown’s Matunuck Oyster Bar for workers at Hasbro Children’s and Rhode Island hospitals, The Providence Journal reports. Frontline Foods is a national organization that pays local restaurants through donations to prepare meals for front-line workers. Davis and her fellow cast members were the first to sponsor a delivery from the Rhode Island chapter, according to Frontline Foods Rhode Island. Columbia: Clemson University plans to hold in-person classes in the fall but synchronize them with online instruction so if a student is infected with COVID-19 – or a second wave of infections closes campus – learning won’t be disrupted. Also on Wednesday, Gov. Henry McMaster announced he is allowing the reopening Friday of mini golf courses, go-kart tracks, museums and amusement parks just in time for the Memorial Day weekend. Beaches were packed last weekend, and authorities blamed large crowds on few things other than the beaches being open. Clemson leaders didn’t provide specifics on their plans in an online presentation to university trustees Wednesday. But everyone who spoke – from Clemson University President Jim Clements to campus safety, academic and financial leaders – all gave a rosy outlook. One thing that wasn’t mentioned was athletics, but Clemson football coach Dabo Swinney has said he is confident the Tigers will play this fall. Sioux Falls: Gov. Kristi Noem said Wednesday that she is appealing to President Donald Trump’s administration in her standoff with two American Indian tribes over coronavirus checkpoints they set up on federal and state highways. Noem said at her daily briefing that she has sent affidavits and video to the White House, the Department of Justice, the Interior Department and her state’s congressional delegation, asking for help resolving the dispute. “This is not taking sides. This is simply upholding the law,” the Republican governor said. The tribes set up the checkpoints last month to keep unnecessary visitors off the reservations. Earlier this month, Noem threatened to sue the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe and the Oglala Sioux Tribe if they did not remove highway stops within 48 hours. She backed away from that plan last week, offering to negotiate on the issue if they would take them off of U.S. and state highways. “I know there are questions out there about respecting (tribal) sovereignty,” Noem said Wednesday. But she contends the checkpoints cannot legally be on those highways. Nashville: The country music capital has begun to loosen restrictions on live music performances that have been curtailed during the coronavirus outbreak. Cities across the state have begun a gradual process of reopening businesses shuttered for safety reasons under orders from local governments and the state. Nashville Mayor John Cooper announced Thursday that the city will move to the second phase of its reopening plan starting next week. That means restaurants and retail stores will be allowed to open at 75% capacity Monday. Salons, barbershops, gyms and other close-contact businesses can reopen at half-capacity, Cooper said. Live music will also be allowed at restaurants, but only if there are no more than two performers on the stage and they remain at least 6 feet apart. However, bars and dance floors will remain closed. Gov. Bill Lee has already lifted similar restrictions for most of the state. Austin: A Texas Supreme Court justice said Thursday that she and her husband have tested positive for the novel coronavirus, making her the highest-ranking state official known to have tested positive for COVID-19. Justice Debra Lehrmann tweeted that she and her husband, Greg, tested positive after showing symptoms last week. She told the Dallas Morning News both had fever and body aches and went to a drive-thru testing center in Austin. Lehrmann said her health has not interfered with her job because the state Supreme Court is working remotely. She said the couple have “strictly adhered” to stay-at-home orders since early March, cooking all their meals at home and wearing masks and gloves to the grocery store. They did get visits from family, which included an infant grandson. “We were just extremely careful – and then we get it,” Lehrman told The Morning News. “How in the world would that happen? We have no idea. All I know is it must be very contagious.” St. George: Southern Utah could see a surge in coronavirus cases after the area experienced its most contagious two weeks since the pandemic hit, the state epidemiologist warned Wednesday. The five counties in the southwestern health district recorded 55 new cases this week and 56 cases the week before, the largest number of new cases since tracking began in mid-March. The uptick can’t be explained by increased testing, epidemiologist Angela Dunn said. “We’re asking the community to be a little more diligent in terms of social distancing recommendations and following health guidance,” Dunn said. “There is a potential for a surge in southern Utah at this point.” The Southwest Utah Public Health Department confirmed its fourth death Tuesday from the virus. It causes flu-like symptoms that many people recover from but can be fatal, especially for older people or those with underlying health conditions. Overall, 90 people have died from the virus in Utah. Marshfield: Gov. Phil Scott on Wednesday proposed a $400 million economic relief and recovery package funded by the federal economic rescue law known as the Cares Act to help employers and small businesses, including dairy farmers, struggling from the pandemic-induced shutdown. “I know this has been a significant sacrifice for far too many families who struggle with unemployment and businesses and entrepreneurs across the state who’ve seen their world and dreams evaporate right before their eyes through no fault of their own,” he said at a press briefing. The first phase is $310 million to help businesses survive right now, he said. It includes grants for those most affected, such as food and accommodation services, retail and agriculture; funding to assist landlords and renters; technical help for business owners; and an in-state marketing campaign to boost local buying, he said. The second phase will be a $90 million investment to help the economy survive and be better equipped to thrive in the future, he said. Richmond: Gov. Ralph Northam says almost 30,000 adults have enrolled in the state’s expanded Medicaid program since he declared a state of emergency in response to the coronavirus pandemic. Northam said Wednesday that more than 420,000 Virginians have enrolled in Medicaid since the state voted to expand it two years ago. Medicaid is a publicly funded health care program whose costs are shared by the federal and state governments. Expanding Medicaid to low-income, able-bodied adults was a key part of former President Barack Obama’s health care overhaul and is one of Northam’s top legislative achievements. Northam said that thousands of adults enrolled in Medicaid have received treatment for underlying conditions that have proved fatal during the pandemic, including high blood pressure and diabetes. Seattle: The state has trained more than 2,100 people to work as contact tracers during the coronavirus outbreak, people who will call every person who tests positive for COVID-19 to find out who they have had close contact with. They then call the contacts to urge them to get tested and quarantine for 14 days, seeking to stop the spread of the virus. About 630 employees of local and state health departments are working on the assignment, The Seattle Times reports. The state has also trained 723 members of the National Guard and 769 employees of the state Department of Licensing to help out. “Case investigations and contact tracing are key pieces of the effort to keep Washington residents safe,” state Health Secretary John Wiesman said. “Both have been critical tools to suppress the virus in other parts of the world.” Of the more than 2,100 trained contact tracers, about 700 are currently active, the Health Department said. Charleston: Gov. Jim Justice on Thursday expanded his aggressive plan to lift coronavirus restrictions after announcing new hot spots in the state’s eastern panhandle. The Republican governor said he is considering a mandatory face mask order for Berkeley and Jefferson counties after at least 35 new cases were reported there in a single day. He has dispatched the National Guard to the region to assess the situation. “We’ll do whatever we have to do, and we’ll pull on the reins until we turn it and it starts flowing back our way,” Justice told reporters. Clay Marsh, a West Virginia University official leading the state’s virus response, said emerging cases in Berkeley and Jefferson counties aren’t surprising, given their proximity to Washington, D.C., and its surrounding suburbs. Justice, right after detailing the spike, set the timeline for the next steps of his reopening strategy. He will allow swimming pools, bowling alleys, spas and video lottery retailers to reopen May 30. On June 5, movie theaters and casinos can open. Madison: Business owners, candidates for office, a pastor and one of the organizers of last month’s “reopen Wisconsin” protest at the Capitol have filed a federal lawsuit alleging that local stay-at-home orders are unconstitutional. The lawsuit, filed by 17 Wisconsin residents Wednesday in federal court in Milwaukee, challenges the local orders that took effect after the state Supreme Court last week tossed out Gov. Tony Evers’ statewide “safer at home” order as unconstitutional. The new lawsuit names 21 state and local Wisconsin public safety and health officials, including Evers and all members of the state elections commission, as defendants. The lawsuit asks the judge to declare the local orders unconstitutional and void them all, claiming violations of the constitutional rights of assembly, free speech, exercise of religion and equal protection. Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul said last week that the local orders, many of which have already been rescinded, were legal. Ryan Nilsestuen, Evers’ attorney, said Thursday that he was confident the new lawsuit will “go nowhere,” noting the Kaul opinion. Hulett: Devils Tower National Monument will partially reopen Friday after an almost two-month closure due to the coronavirus pandemic. The National Park Service announced on the Devils Tower website that roads, trails, rock climbing and a picnic area will open for Memorial Day weekend. A visitor center and campground will remain closed. Roads and trails in Fossil Butte National Monument in western Wyoming have remained open, but the visitor center there is closed. Yellowstone and Grand Teton national parks began a limited reopening Monday after a seven-week closure. Most facilities including lodges and campgrounds remain closed. Devils Tower is an igneous rock formation almost 1,300 feet high. Native Americans consider the tower sacred, but it’s a popular destination for rock climbers.

13,13,'50 states and 50 different approaches:' States scramble to hire COVID-19 contact tracersKen Alltucker and Jayne O'Donnell ,"May 13, 2020",https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2020/05/13/coronavirus-states-scramble-hire-covid-19-contact-tracers/3088014001/,"Rachel Brummert left her home in Charlotte, North Carolina, just once after March 2: to pick up a prescription at CVS on March 18. That made the job of the contact tracer from the Mecklenburg County health department a lot easier after Brummert, 49, got her positive COVID-19 results on April 9. The tracer had only two other transmission possibilities to consider. She had to talk to people near Brummert’s husband at the financial services company office where he worked until March 18, and find a 26-year-old neighbor who two days later left groceries on the bottom step while Brummert stood on the top step. Public health officials are counting on such methodical contact tracing coupled with aggressive testing as the nation’s strategy to combat the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, which has killed more than 81,000 Americans at a continued rate of about 2,000 a day. “This tidal wave has hit,” said David Levy, CEO of EHE Health. “Other than an effective antiviral or vaccine, the only solution is testing and tracing.” But Levy said the lack of a coordinated, national approach has left “50 different states and 50 different approaches” to control a virus that does not stop at state or county borders. If states are unable to get adequate controls in place, some warn that a surge in infections would overwhelm the ability of contact tracers to help slow the spread. COVID-19 Expert:Coronavirus will rage 'until it infects everybody it possibly can' Antibody tests:They were supposed to help guide reopening plans. They've brought more confusion than clarity. Still, other than keeping stay-at-home orders firmly in place, public health officials say rapid testing and contact tracing give states the best chance to slow the virus and restart the economy crippled by the highest rate of unemployment since the Great Depression. And as states ease stay-at-home restrictions and allow people to return to work, shopping and social activities, testing and tracing the contacts of infected people will become crucial. The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has issued broad guidelines and training resources for state and local public health agencies. The Trump administration, however, halted the release of a plan that would advise local public health agencies on strategies to reopen public places, the Associated Press reported. CDC Director Robert Redfield said during a U.S.Senate hearing Tuesday that contact tracing is ""going to be the difference from succeeding in containing this outbreak” or widespread transmission in communities. He said the agency has 500 staff members on the effort and is looking to add another 650, but he stressed efforts to work with local health departments to get contact tracing capability in place by September. “It’s going to be significant effort to build the contact tracing capacity that we need in this nation,” he said. Without an overarching plan, state public health agencies are developing their own strategies on hiring and training contact tracers. Massachusetts has added more than 1,000 workers and sent some into communities with large numbers of cases. California last week began training the first recruits of a planned 20,000-person contact tracing team. And New York plans to add as many as 17,000 contact tracers through a partnership with former Mayor Mike Bloomberg, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and Resolve to Save Lives, headed by former CDC Director Tom Frieden. Dr. Marcus Plescia is chief medical officer of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials. The organization completed a study with Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security that estimated 100,000 new contact tracers are needed nationwide. The estimated price tag: $3.6 billion. He said testing, isolating and tracking the contacts of new cases is pivotal as the nation enters a new phase of the pandemic. “Everybody is impatient and ready to start reopening society and the economy,” Plescia said. “Unless we have some kind of infection control mechanism in place, it’s just a matter of time until we rev right back up into the same situation we’re starting to recover from.” Brummert was impressed by the efficiency of Mecklenburg County health department's investigation.  On April 21, health department officials told her they cleared other potential sources and concluded she was likely infected by the CVS keypad when she typed in her debit card number to pay for her prescription back in March.   CVS has had ""very few engagements"" with state and local health department contact tracers investigating COVID-19 cases involving customers, said Mike DeAngelis, a senior director of corporate communications The chain pharmacy frequently cleans hard surfaces and commonly handled items, has reduced the number of keypad prompts a customer must touch and puts disinfecting wipe stations at the front of each store, according to DeAngelis. ""We’ve enacted measures in our stores to help ensure proper social distancing, including floor markers to help our customers be mindful of how close they are to others, and we have installed protective panels at our pharmacy counters and front-store checkout stations in all stores,"" DeAngelis said.  Brummert, who has the inflammatory disorder sarcoidosis, was picking up her immune suppressant medications on March 18. She looked for face masks in the aisle near the pharmacy, but to be extra cautious, she said she didn’t stop for her usual snacks. By March 21, she had a high fever, headache and trouble breathing, but she couldn’t get tested until April 2. A week later, she learned she had COVID-19, and she was contacted by a county health department contact tracer within a couple of days. She couldn’t get tested earlier because she had not knowingly come in contact with anyone who was infected or traveled out of the country. She was told to isolate for 14 days. On April 2, she went to the local emergency room in what she described as “respiratory distress,” and was prescribed the antibiotic azithromycin and the breathing treatment albuterol. Her chest X-ray was filled with what she said appeared to be “white smoke.” She wasn’t hospitalized because “our hospitals were overwhelmed with people who needed to be on ventilators,” she said. The health department said she could come out of isolation one week after her symptoms disappeared, including at least 72 hours fever-free without Tylenol. That happened on April 26, though she has stayed home to be extra cautious after hearing people can become reinfected. Brummert said she doesn't want to rely on contact tracing, even with increased testing, to keep people safe now that shelter in place restrictions are being lifted. “Contact tracing is complicated by itself and becomes a more complex issue when we consider those who are essential workers or have to travel,” said Brummert, a consumer representative on advisory committee for the the Food and Drug Administration’s Center for Devices and Radiologic Health. “What makes contact tracing even more disconcerting is that people who are asymptomatic can also spread the virus.” North Carolina is working to rapidly expand its ranks of contact tracers under the state's newly adopted Carolina Community Tracing Collaborative.  Under the program, Community Care of North Carolina will use state funding to hire 250 contact tracers. Community Care will not know how much the independent contractors will be paid until state funding amounts are finalized, nor does it know how long the positions will last given the unknowns about COVID-19's trajectory. ""We’ve gotten a surge of applications, nearly 5,000 applications,"" said Paul Mahoney, Community Care's vice president for communications. ""The unemployment rate is off the charts right now."" Contact tracers will be hired from communities with the greatest need based on number of cases and resources of the local health departments, Mahoney said. That might mean contact tracers working from their own homes in small and rural towns that need help the most, Mahoney said. Massachusetts has tapped Partners in Health, a Boston-based nonprofit with extensive experience in international public health responses. Partners in Health contact tracers are making thousands of calls a day to Massachusetts communities hard hit the virus. With the stay-at-home orders leaving thousands of workers furloughed or laid off, there’s no shortage of applicants. Partners in Health has hired more than 1,000 from a pool of about 40,000 people who applied for positions in the state, said John C. Welch, director of partnerships and operations for the MA Covid Response project. Welch said the large pool of job-seekers means Partners in Health can quickly add staff if Massachusetts has a surge of cases. The nonprofit recruited for three types of jobs. Case investigators contact a person who tests positive, advises them to isolate and interviews them to get a list of contacts who might’ve been exposed to the virus. Contact tracers, which make up the bulk of new hires, reach out to people the infected person contacted. Those interviews can be done over the phone or face-to-face if the person can’t be reached by phone. The CDC defines a close contact as someone within 6 feet of an infected person for at least 15 minutes. The agency recommends close contacts of an infected person should stay home and monitor symptoms until 14 days after a known exposure.  A third group of new hires, care resource coordinators, connect people who must isolate with resources such as food delivery services, medical care or other social services. Contact tracing helped end the Ebola out:Public health experts say it can stop COVID-19, too Public health agencies are well versed on contact tracing for infectious diseases such as measles or HIV. Given the fast spread and spread of COVID-19, contact tracers hired to counter novel coronavirus face a much larger job. “It’s really important to teach the public about what contact tracing is,” Welch said. “Contact tracing happens every day for over 90 reportable infectious diseases. People aren’t necessarily aware of those day-to-day activities by the public health sector.” Partners in Health has sought to raise awareness of what it does statewide but also through targeted outreach and engagement in Boston-area communities such as Chelsea, Revere and Brockton, Welch said. “Those areas have had relatively high transmission rates populated by a lot of working class individuals,” he said. “These are the folks who are keeping food on our table, keeping gas in our cars and keeping our hospitals clean. Those folks are experiencing the burden of disease transmission.” The state released a public awareness video about contact tracing to encourage people to pick up the phone. Many were ignoring calls because they feared being scammed or getting an unwanted call. The nonprofit worked with telecommunication companies to make sure their calls were not blocked, Welch said. “The people who we’ve been in touch with have been happy to hear from us and glad to have positive outreach,” Welch said. “Contact tracing is an act of caring, and by and large, people see that.” Others say large-scale contact tracing will be difficult to put in place in time to make a meaningful difference.  Dr. Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, said hiring thousands of people with limited or no public health experience to do contact tracing is ""a great idea on paper"" but will struggle to keep up with the pace of the virus. He advocates a more limited approach: Public health workers contacting infected individuals and encouraging them to stay home until they recover.  ""Once you see a big escalation in cases, contact tracing absolutely cannot work,"" Osterholm said. ""You will be having contacts by the thousands and thousands and thousands. It’s just not going to work."" More:Apple and Google join forces on tech for app that could warn you of coronavirus exposure Others worry about how effective or complete tracking will be. Dr. George Fallieras of Los Angeles returned from a ski trip in Aspen, Colorado, when he suddenly felt a “crushing fatigue” and body aches. However, he did not have a fever, cough, sore throat or trouble breathing – classic symptoms of COVID-19. He knew something was wrong but could not get a test based on his symptoms. He did not want to potentially expose others at a hospital emergency room or his patients to anything. Fallieras talked with a colleague, an infectious disease doctor, who arranged testing. He tested positive for COVID-19, isolated himself and has recovered. Since then, because he has antibodies believed to offer some immunity, he began working at Los Angeles Surge Hospital, a newly opened facility in downtown L.A. for COVID-19 patients. While the hospital caters to patients with more serious complications from COVID-19, Fallieras wonders about patients like himself, those with mild symptoms or symptoms different from those most commonly described. He worries people with mild cases might not ever get tested and could pass the virus to someone more vulnerable, such as an older adult or a person with an underlying health condition that makes them more susceptible to complications. “It is a blessing that many people are asymptomatic,” Fallieras said. But “that makes it very difficult to contact trace and isolate.” California will attempt exactly that with an army of 20,000 contact tracers, under an ambitious initiative announced by Gov. Gavin Newsom last week. The University of California-San Francisco and the University of California-Los Angeles will train the new workers, many of whom have no public health experience. Newly recruited tracers began a 20-hour online training course last week. Plescia, of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, said it’s important for states to hire contract tracers by this summer. He said states partnering with universities and cities such as San Francisco, which is using librarians and medical students, will have an advantage to quickly get contact tracers in the field. “It has to be in place,” he said. “If we don’t, the concern is the next surge will not come in the fall, it will come sooner.” Frieden, a former New York City heath commissioner who headed the CDC during the Obama administration, acknowledged that contract tracing will become more difficult as social distancing protocols ease. Under social distancing, Frieden said, he has had only two contacts. That could expand from 20 to 100 as his state loosens restrictions, making tracing much more difficult. ""This is a big challenge to do contact tracing on this scale and with this speed,"" Frieden said. ""There is skepticism. Is it really possible? The truth is we are not going to be able to find every case. ""Just because you can’t solve all of the problem doesn’t mean you shouldn’t solve any of the problem.""

14,14,"Fact check: Under TRACE Act, cellphones will not be updated with ‘COVID-19 traceability'McKenzie Sadeghi ","May 20, 2020",https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2020/05/17/fact-check-hr-6666-cellphones-not-updated-covid-19-traceability/5206290002/,"The TRACE Act stirred controversy on social media and brought forth privacy concerns, as social media users claimed that phones would be updated with traceability apps – without anyone knowing – to track the spread of COVID-19. A Facebook post with an image that states ""Know what HR 6666 means for our country"" includes a section that states: “Cellphones are being updated with ‘Covid-19 Traceability’ apps without us even knowing it. (See in comments to shut off this setting).” It adds, “This app will track where you’ve been, who you’ve been in contact with, and random strangers your phone has been 6 ft away from.” Users in the comments on the post claimed that the traceability app could be turned off on cellphones in the settings section by selecting the Health button and turning off “COVID-19 Exposure Notifications.” This post is one of several claims that followed the announcement of House Resolution 6666, the TRACE Act: Testing, Reaching and Contacting Everyone that is sponsored by Rep. Bobby Rush. D-Ill., on May 1. The TRACE Act includes a $100 billion grant that will be used to allocate money to nonprofit organizations, health centers, medical facilities, and more, to implement testing units and hire staff in hotspot areas to track and reduce COVID-19 cases. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has already issued guidance stating contact tracing is a key strategy for preventing COVID-19. “Communities must scale up and train a large contact tracer workforce and work collaboratively across public and private agencies to stop the transmission of COVID-19,” the website reads. The bill also would use funds to purchase personal protective equipment and hire, train and compensate individuals' expenses. Priority would be given to “applicants that agree, in hiring individuals to carry out activities funded under this section, to hire residents of the area or community where the activities will primarily occur, with higher priority among applicants described in this paragraph given based on the percentage of individuals to be hire from such area or community.” There is no mention in the text of the bill that cellphone apps will be used to track coronavirus or exposure to it. Another part of the bill reads: “Nothing in this section shall be construed to supersede any Federal privacy of confidentiality requirement.” Rush has also emphasized on Twitter that privacy will not be violated, including regulations under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 — known as HIPAA — and the Public Health Service Act. Google and Apple announced April 1 a joint effort to develop technical tools and use Bluetooth technology to help the government and health agencies reduce the spread of COVID-19 with privacy and security measures still in place. “Apple and Google will be launching a comprehensive solution that includes application programming interfaces (APIs) and operating system-level technology to assist in enabling contact tracing,” a news release from Apple reads. “Given the urgent need, the plan is to implement this solution in two steps while maintaining strong protections around user privacy.” Their plan states that both Google and Apple will release APIs that will cooperate with Android and iOS devices and will use apps from public health authorities. The apps are not required and will be available for download via app stores. A Bluetooth-based contact tracing platform, to which individuals would opt in, would allow more users to participate.  Fact check: What's true and what's false about coronavirus? We rate the claim that cellphones will be updated with COVID-19 tracing apps under the TRACE Act or other initiatives as FALSE because it was not supported by our research. Nothing in the bill mentions that apps and cellphones will be used to trace the coronavirus. Rep. Bobby Rush, the bill's sponsor, has stated that nothing in the bill supersedes federal privacy requirements. While companies like Google and Apple have introduced plans to create apps, it is noted that apps would be for voluntary use and individuals would decide if they want to opt in or out.

15,15,The COVID-19 tracing apps are coming – and privacy trade-offs with themMatt O'Brien and Christina Larson ,"May 6, 2020",https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2020/05/05/privacy-covid-19-contact-tracing-apps-google-apple/3085620001/,"As governments around the world consider how to monitor new coronavirus outbreaks while reopening their societies, many are starting to bet on smartphone apps to help stanch the pandemic. But their decisions on which technologies to use – and how far those allow authorities to peer into private lives – are highlighting some uncomfortable trade-offs between protecting privacy and public health. ""There are conflicting interests,"" said Tina White, a Stanford University researcher who first introduced a privacy-protecting approach in February. ""Governments and public health (agencies) want to be able to track people"" to minimize the spread of COVID-19, but people are less likely to download a voluntary app if it is intrusive, she said. Containing infectious disease outbreaks boils down to a simple mantra: test, trace and isolate. Today, that means identifying people who test positive for the novel coronavirus, tracking down others they might have infected, and preventing further spread by quarantining everyone who might be contagious.  That second step requires an army of health care workers to question coronavirus carriers about recent contacts so those people can be tested and potentially isolated. Smartphone apps could speed up that process by collecting data about your movements and alerting you if you've spent time near a confirmed coronavirus carrier. The more detailed that data, the more it could help regional governments identify and contain emerging disease ""hot spots."" But data collected by governments can also be abused by governments – or their private-sector partners. Some countries and local governments are issuing voluntary government-designed apps that make information directly available to public health authorities.  In Australia, more than 3 million people have downloaded such an app touted by the prime minister, who compared it to the ease of applying sunscreen and said more app downloads would bring about a ""more liberated economy and society."" Utah is the first U.S. state to embrace a similar approach, one developed by a social media startup previously focused on helping young people hang out with nearby friends.  Both these apps record a digital trail of the strangers an individual encountered. Utah's goes even further, using a device's location to help track which restaurants or stores a user has visited. The app is ""a tool to help jog the memory of the person who is positive so we can more readily identify where they've been, who they've been in contact with, if they choose to allow that,"" said Angela Dunn, Utah's state epidemiologist. A competing approach under development by tech giants Apple and Google limits the information collected and anonymizes what it pulls in so that such personalized tracking isn't possible.  Apple and Google have pushed for public health agencies to adopt their privacy-oriented model, offering an app-building interface they say will work smoothly on billions of phones when the software rolls out sometime in May. Germany and a growing number of European countries have aligned with that approach, while others, such as France and the UK, have argued for more government access to app data.  Most coronavirus-tracking apps rely on Bluetooth, a decades-old short-range wireless technology, to locate other phones nearby that are running the same app. The Bluetooth apps keep a temporary record of the signals they encounter. If one person using the app is later confirmed to have COVID-19, public health authorities can use that stored data to identify and notify other people who may have been exposed. Apple and Google say that apps built to their specifications will work across most iPhones and Android devices, eliminating compatibility problems. They have also forbidden governments to make their apps compulsory and are building in privacy protections to keep stored data out of government and corporate hands and ease concerns about surveillance. For instance, these apps rely on encrypted ""peer to peer"" signals sent from phone to phone; these aren't stored in government databases and are designed to conceal individual identities and connections. Public-health officials aren't even in the loop; these apps would notify users directly of their possible exposure and urge them to get tested. In the U.S., developers are pitching their apps directly to state and local governments. In Utah, the social media company Twenty sold state officials on an approach combining Bluetooth with satellite-based GPS signals. That would let trained health workers help connect the dots and discover previously hidden clusters of infection. ""It's unlikely that automated alerts are going to be enough,"" said Jared Allgood, Twenty's chief strategy officer and a Utah resident, citing estimates that the peer-to-peer models would need most people participating to be effective. North and South Dakota are pursuing a similar model after a local startup repurposed its existing Bison Tracker app, originally designed to connect fans of North Dakota State University's athletic teams. Regardless of the approach, none of these apps will be effective at breaking chains of viral infections unless countries like the U.S. can ramp up coronavirus testing and hire more health workers to do manual outreach.  Another big limitation: Many people, particularly in vulnerable populations, don't carry smartphones.  In Singapore, for instance, a large migrant worker population lives in cramped dorms, makes about $15 a day, and powers the city's previously booming construction industry — but smartphone usage in this group is low. When the Southeast Asian city-state launched its tracing app in March, total confirmed COVID-19 cases were well under 1,000. Then in early April, a rash of new infections in worker dormitories pushed that number to more than 18,000, triggering new lockdown policies. ""If we can find a way to automate some of the detective work with technology, I think that would be a significant help,"" said Nadia Abuelezam, a disease researcher at Boston College. ""It won't be all we need.""

As infections appear to be peaking in major metropolitan areas and states begin relaxing social distancing, America might well require an army of what are called ""contact tracers"" to guard against a COVID-19 counterattack. Contact tracers are a crucial part of a health response to any contagious disease. But they need not have medical training. They act more like investigators. With skills that can be easily taught, contact tracers interview the newly infected to learn who else that person might have been in contact with during the previous two weeks (the incubation period for COVID-19) and then reach out to that circle of people to alert them that they were exposed to coronavirus and urge that they isolate themselves for two weeks. If any among this second tier are infected, the volunteers would interview them to learn identities of yet another circle of contacts and repeat the exercise. This low-tech process could be supplemented with cellphone apps being developed by Apple and Google. Short of a vaccine or effective treatment, this ""test, trace and isolate"" process is how infection chains are broken and new coronavirus outbreaks tamped down.  HHS:Trump administration putting boots on the ground to help states Contact tracing is a time-honored health procedure dating to at least 1937, when the U.S. Surgeon General first used it to combat the spread of syphilis. It was employed effectively during the Ebola scare in 2014. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention attempted to use contact tracing in February, when only 14 cases of coronavirus had been identified. But because of a slow federal response and a lack of testing kits, the highly contagious disease rapidly spread beyond those containment efforts. Contact tracing quickly gave way to a desperate effort to ""flatten the curve"" to prevent hospitals from being overwhelmed with COVID patients. Testing has since ramped up, and with the nation's success at social distancing, the numbers of infections appear to be ebbing. A new report released by the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security estimates that, to prevent a resurgence, the United States would need at least 100,000 contact tracers spread out across the country in a mobilizing effort led by counties and states, with guidance and coordination from the CDC and funding from Congress.  If Americans long to get out of their homes and resume some sense of normalcy in the months before a vaccine is developed, say the authors of the Johns Hopkins analysis, contact tracing is the key. ""Time is of the essence to get contact up and running,"" according to co-author Anita Cicero, deputy director of the Center for Health Security.  The analysis argues that people hired as contact tracers could earn the average wage of a community health worker: $17 an hour, useful income at a time of high unemployment. Public health graduate students could be candidates. The cost nationwide would amount to about $3.6 billion, money Congress should allocate.  On Monday, bipartisan health leaders led by Andy Slavitt, former director of Medicare and Medicaid in the Obama administration, and Scott Gottlieb, a former Food and Drug Administration commissioner in the Trump administration, called on Congress to spend $12 billion to help expand the contact tracing workforce by 180,000 people until a vaccine becomes available. Massachusetts, Mississippi, Utah and Washington are among the states gearing up contact tracing teams. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo last week announced a coordinated effort by his state, New Jersey and Connecticut to create a ""tracing army"" led by former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg, who is kicking in $10.5 million. Some states, including Alaska, Georgia and Oklahoma, are riskily relaxing social distancing measures with only limited or nascent tracing programs in place. National leadership is needed to promote contact tracing and to coordinate a broad effort. People who want to enlist should look to their local and state health agencies for where to sign up. And here's an idea: a revised recruitment poster with an artist's rendering of the nation's most noted expert on COVID-19, Dr. Anthony Fauci, pointedly telling us ""I want you"" to serve as a contact tracer.

The decision was made after six symptomatic athletes tested positive for COVID-19. “The impacted students have been placed in isolation and contact tracing procedures have been initiated following protocol,” the statement from the department said. The announcement did not specify the sports in which the athletes are participants. ""UH Athletics will continue to partner with university officials, UH team physicians and local health professionals to determine best practices as it considers a return to workouts,” the statement concluded. While the fall sports season is still weeks away, this development illustrates the complications that could come into play as conferences and athletic departments grapple with how to conduct competitions in a world still trying to recover from the pandemic. Houston had reopened its facilities on June 1, but these cases as well as an increase in positive tests around the greater Houston area led officials to take this action. "

Houston announced it was shutting down workouts due to “an abundance of caution” and an increase of positive tests in the greater Houston area over the last week. The school said the athletes, who were not identified, have been placed in isolation and medical staff is conducting contact-tracing procedures. Schools around the country have begun bringing athletes back to campus this month for voluntary workouts. Athletes are being tested for COVID-19 and coronavirus antibodies and given physical screenings through examines and questionnaires. There is no national standardized testing protocol for athletes. Positive tests results had been expected and quickly have become fairly common as schools bring athletes back. Arkansas State announced seven athletes test positive. Alabama has had at least five. Clemson reported three athletes testing positive among 169 tests on students and coaches. UCF, Houston's American Athletic Conference rival, reported three positives from its first 60 tests. Houston was the first school to report its positive athletes were symptomatic and to halt workouts because of the results. ___"
19,19,Fact check: Bill Gates is not planning to microchip the world through a COVID-19 vaccineMatthew Brown and Elizabeth Weise ,"Jun. 12, 2020",https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2020/06/12/fact-check-bill-gates-isnt-planning-implant-microchips-via-vaccines/3171405001/,"Bill Gates has long been the target of conspiracy theories about his vast fortune and charitable giving. But claims about the tech tycoon have reached a fever pitch in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. ""Gates wants us microchipped and Fauci wants us to carry vax certificates,” reads one Facebook post with 22,000 shares. The same language has appeared on multiple posts on the platform. “Due to the large number of people who will refuse the forthcoming covid-19 vaccine because it will include tracking microchips, the Gates Foundation is now spending billions of dollars to ensure that all medical and dental injections and procedures include the chips so that the only way to avoid being 'chipped' will be to refuse any and all dental and medical treatment,” another viral post on Facebook reads. The claim has also gone viral on Spanish language pages and media, with some casting Gates as the mastermind of a massive conspiracy that echoes several other claims, including that Gates helped write the House Democrats’ proposed legislation, the TRACE Act. Gates is not planning on implanting microchips in people around the world through vaccines. The claim has been debunked multiple times since the beginning of the pandemic, however, the allegation persists in many online corners. More:Fact check: Bill Gates did not craft contact tracing bill ""I've never been involved any sort of microchip-type thing,"" Gates said during a call with reporters on June 3, adding, ""It's almost hard to deny this stuff because it's so stupid or strange."" Gates meant for the call to be an announcement of another $1.6 billion in funding for immunization in lower-income countries, but the rampant conspiracy theories still came up. Many conspiracy theorists have claimed that Gates’ donations to public health efforts in developing countries are secretly mind control efforts. “In a way, it’s so bizarre you almost want to see it as something humorous but it’s really not a humorous thing,” Gates said. The coronavirus pandemic is ripe for misinformation. “It’s frightening, it’s hard to understand, it’s required governments to restrict individual freedoms, and it will lead to mass vaccinations,” Matthew Hornsey, a social psychologist at the University of Queensland in Australia who studies scientific messaging, told USA TODAY. “That’s a perfect storm for conspiracy theories.” There is no evidence that Gates or any major institution is attempting to implant microchips in people through COVID-19 vaccines. Gates and others have repeatedly denied the claims. Regardless, a May 20 Yahoo News/YouGov poll found that 44% of Republicans and 19% of Democrats believe that Gates is planning to implant microchips in billions of people. “This illness has been so severe I thought the anti-vaccine folks would be more muted in their approach, but this is apparently not the case,” William Schaffner, a professor of preventive medicine and infectious disease at Vanderbilt University, told USA TODAY. “Here, people have a single issue that they have rallied behind; they don’t trust vaccinations. Conspiracy theories are then selectively embraced to justify that feeling,"" Hornsey said. ""That’s why people are prepared to believe ideas that seem strange and ridiculous to the rest of us. They want to believe it, so they set a very low bar for evidence.” Rich and famous people are frequently the center of conspiracy theories. The fact that Gates is a vocal proponent of public health initiatives long scrutinized by conspiratorial-minded groups only makes him an even riper target. It is possible that the conspiracy theory partly originated from a December study published by a team at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The study was funded, in part, by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. The team had developed an ""approach to encode medical history on a patient"" by including a small amount of dye with a vaccine. The dye, which would be invisible to the naked eye but observable through a specialized cellphone app using infrared light, would keep a record of a child's vaccines. The technique may be especially useful in developing countries, where record keeping is often more difficult. The study never experimented on humans and did not involve any hardware technology, like microchips. More:Fact check: Dr. Anthony Fauci, Bill Gates won't profit from drug remdesivir “The quantum dot dye technology is not a microchip or human-implantable capsule and to my knowledge there are no plans to use this for coronavirus,"" Kevin McHugh, a lead author on the study, told Reuters. Gates and his foundation have been very supportive of contact tracing efforts around the globe. The Gates Foundation has also funded vaccine efforts in developing countries over the years. These individual facts often combine online into narratives like the Gates microchip conspiracy theory, with no substantiating evidence. ""The fear of insertion of tracking chips and other things like that into our bodies has been a longstanding bogeyman for theorists,"" Mark Fenster, a University of Florida law professor, told PolitiFact. ""There is a lot of tracking that goes on, but the suggestion that it’s being used in this manner and this way seems absurd,"" he continued. More:Fact check: What's true and what's false about coronavirus? Others have also tried to link claims that Gates wants to create a ""digital certificate"" or ""digital identity"" for all people with the microchip conspiracy theory. Gates has said that some kind of ""immunity certificate"" may be necessary to reopen the economy, but the intended idea is far from mass surveillance or microchipping. ""Eventually what we’ll have to have is certificates of who’s a recovered person and who’s a vaccinated person, because you don’t want people moving around the world where you’ll have some countries that won’t have it under control,"" Gates said during a March TED Talk. That certificate would not be a physical implant or chip, but rather a digital item one could have on their smartphone or other personal device, as Gates later explained. Anxieties about mass surveillance are a persistent issue in the digital age, further exacerbating conspiracy theories about the potential for microchipping from famous tech tycoons or the federal government. There is no evidence that Bill Gates is trying to implant microchips in people around the world through COVID-19 vaccines.

20,20,"Contact tracing helped end the Ebola outbreak; public health experts say it can stop COVID-19, tooAdrianna Rodriguez ","Apr. 21, 2020",https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2020/04/17/coronavirus-contact-tracing-may-stop-covid-19-cases-ebola-expert-says/5143666002/,"A public health expert who led the fight against the Ebola outbreak in Liberia said the United States is downplaying one strategy to stop the coronavirus pandemic: contact tracing. Tolbert Nyenswah, senior research associate at the Department of International Health at the Johns Hopkins’ Bloomberg School of Public Health, said successful contact tracing could reopen the country within two to three months. “By now, 100% of all people coming in contact with COVID-19 patients must be traced,” he said. “Even one missed contact can keep the outbreak going on and on and on.” According to a report released last week by researchers at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, the nation needs a workforce of 100,000 contact tracers. At that scale, the effort would require $3.6 billion, researchers projected. They called for an infusion of emergency funding from Congress. Their estimates are based on what worked in other countries. In the Wuhan, China, region where the outbreak started, 9,000 contact tracers were rapidly deployed to curb the spread in thecity of 11 million. The World Health Organization breaks down contact tracing into three basic steps: identification, listing and follow-up. Once a patient tests positive for the virus, contacts are identified by asking whom the patient came in contact with, such as family members, colleagues, friends or health care providers. Then tracers attempt to identify and reach out to all those who came into contact with the COVID-19-positive patient. Regular follow-ups should be conducted with all contacts to monitor for symptoms. Even though U.S. cases surpassed 760,000 as of Monday morning, Nyenswah said contact tracing down to the last household is possible.  “For us to get ahead of the curve, for us to flatten the curve, for us to bend the curve, to stop the outbreak … contact tracing, contact tracing, contact tracing,” Nyenswah said, recounting the extreme efforts of trackers in rural Africa compared with a first-world nation such as the USA. “It’s cumbersome, it’s painstaking, it might take a long time to do it,"" he said. ""It can be done."" Matthew Fox, professor of epidemiology and global health at Boston University, is in favor of contact tracing but said he doesn’t thinkthe USA can get down to zero cases before a vaccine is available in the next few years. “I think it’s being downplayed in the media, but I don’t think it’s going to be the solution to all our problems,” he said. “We think coronavirus is far more transmissible. Ebola, you need to come in contact with bodily fluids … droplet transmission is so much harder.” Tech giants:Apple and Google team up on coronavirus tracking technology Trump wants to reopen America:Federal health officials warn the bar to do so safely may be too high Fox said contact tracing plays an important part in a broader strategy incorporating other public health measures to minimize transmission. Although it won’t make much of an impact as cases in the country climb, he said, it’s important to start scaling up contact tracing for when case numbers become more manageable. John Welch, director of partnerships and operations for Massachusetts' COVID response for Partners in Health, is hiring about 900 contact tracers for the state.  Partners in Health – a nonprofit global health organization – estimates those people will make 80,000 to 100,000 calls a week, working 12 hours a day for all seven days. Welch said contact tracers will not only keep track of contacts but will redirect patients in need to the proper resources for testing or treatment.

21,21,What should you do if you lost or threw away your stimulus?Susan Tompor ,6:45 p.m. ET Jun. 12,https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2020/06/12/how-track-lost-thrown-away-stimulus-money/3173999001/,"Did you pitch your much-awaited stimulus payment because it showed up on a plastic card that, frankly, looked like an unsolicited debit or credit card?  Some people treated those envelopes like junk mail. After all, the card arrived in a plain envelope – marked Money Network Cardholder Services, not U.S. Treasury – and many people had absolutely no idea that they could be tossing away a piece of plastic that gave access to thousands of dollars.  Well, here's a bit of good news. You now won't be charged $7.50  to get a replacement card.  In an email to tax professionals Monday, the Internal Revenue Service said people who have lost or destroyed their Visa prepaid debit cards now can request a free replacement through MetaBank’s customer service department, as reported by Accounting Today.  George Floyd's Minneapolis:Multicultural facade hid decades of simmering racial inequality PlayStation 5:These were the 10 biggest game announcements Thursday Normally, you would have been hit with a $7.50 fee for reissuing that card.  The prepaid debit card was one of the odder, more confusing twists of the rollout of stimulus money – or Economic Impact Payments – during the coronavirus relief effort. Many people had never heard that the IRS was sending prepaid debit cards to some; the IRS made note online at IRS.gov on May 20 of the debit cards issued by MetaBank.  The card, of course, is not the only headache associated with the rollout of stimulus payments that began in mid-April.  So here are some of the latest updates from the IRS that could help many people who have still not received money or lost it. The IRS continues to regularly update its FAQ under ""Get My Payment"" to address some areas of confusion. Fortunately, the IRS said you don't need to know the number on that card to request a replacement. You can call 800-240-8100 (select option 2 from the main menu). Once you get that card, it's possible to transfer it to a bank account if you want. The new limit for electronic transfers to your bank account is $2,500 per transaction – up from a previously announced $1,000. See EIPcard.com to review the process. Transfers should post to your bank account in one to two business days. Maybe or maybe not. Now the IRS ""Get My Payment"" site warns at the top: ""If the Get My Payment application says you’re receiving a check, your payment may come as a debit card. Debit card payments come in a plain envelope from 'Money Network Cardholder Services.' ""  Yes, a plain envelope.  About 4 million people who don't have direct deposit information on file with the IRS are expected to see their Economic Impact Payments on prepaid debit cards. The cards first began hitting mailboxes in late May.   No. But scammers might call pretending to be from the IRS or another agency and offer to ""help"" you process your Economic Impact Payment. Don't share your Social Security or bank account information with those impersonating the IRS. Now, it's a waiting game. The IRS has to mail a payment to the address it has on file for you, if the bank rejected the deposit. If an account is closed or was invalid, the bank will reject the deposit. ""Typically, once the payment is mailed, it will take up to 14 days to receive the payment, standard mailing time,"" the IRS said.  Some direct deposit efforts ran into a glitch since some bank accounts on file were temporary setups that were used by tax preparers as part of a tax refund process and those accounts are no longer active.   If your address changed, you may need to go through the process of changing it on file with the IRS. One way to do so is by filing Form 8822, Change of Address.  The IRS has a tool online called ""Get My Payment"" to help you track stimulus payments.  According to the IRS, if Get My Payment shows your payment was issued but you have not received it, you may need to try to trace the payment. But you shouldn't jump to track it too soon.  The IRS said: You should not try to trace it unless it has been more than five days since the scheduled direct deposit date. Or if you were expecting a check, you'd need to wait more than four weeks. Or wait six weeks if you have a forwarding address on file with the local post office. Or wait nine weeks from that scheduled date if you have a foreign address. More:Don't throw away those Visa debit cards: They have stimulus cash More:Haven't gotten a coronavirus relief check? Some must act to get their money. To trace your payment, call the IRS at 800-919-9835 or you may submit Form 3911. Granted, if you call, expect a long wait time.  If you submit the form and you are married filing joint, both spouses must sign the form. If the check wasn't cashed, the IRS said, you'll receive a replacement check once the original check is canceled. (Note: If you find the original check and receive a replacement, you must return the original as soon as possible.) If the refund check was cashed, the Bureau of the Fiscal Service will provide you with a claim package that includes a copy of the cashed check. The bureau will review your claim and the signature on the canceled check before determining whether they can issue you a replacement check. Oh, don't use the payment trace process as a short cut. The IRS said you should not request a payment trace if you're trying to figure out if you were eligible or you should have received more money for the stimulus payments.  ContactSusan Tompor at stompor@freepress.com.

22,22,How states around the country are planning a return for high school sportsEthan Sears ,12:25 p.m. ET Jun. 13,https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/highschool/2020/06/13/high-school-sports-try-return-amid-challenges-coronavirus/5346526002/,"Bobby Cox talked about whistles in a recent staff meeting. About officials, standing near the action, using a device that blasts airfar more than six feet. That’s a scary thought right now. The National Federation of State High School Associations has discussed using an electronic signal. Guidance released by Indiana's Department of Education doesn't touch on it and Cox, Indiana High School Athletic Association's executive director, thinks whistles will be used in the fall. At least in some sports. Others might use an air horn instead. That is, if contests are played at all. Down to even that level of detail, every piece of every high school game is being evaluated now as state athletic associations around the country try to chart a path toward playing in the fall amid the coronavirus pandemic. There’s no playbook. The information at hand changes daily. So do the situations in each state.  There’s optimism, steeped in caution and uncertainty. Nobody has changed the calendar, and nobody can commit to keeping it. “I think the key with all of this has been that there’s really no roadmap here,” Cox said. “Everybody’s state is affected a little differently.""” As in most other states, Indiana has a date at which conditioning work can start — July 6. Kids will be in small groups, and get symptoms and temperatures checked prior to participating, along with a slew of other guidelines. By Aug. 15, the expected start date for Phase III of reopening extracurricular activities, that could build into games with fans in attendance and even concession stands operational. But that’s all contingent on everything going well in the early stages, on getting the necessary hand sanitizer, disinfectant and personal protective equipment, on schools reopening in September, on officials who could be putting themselves at risk working games, on parents being comfortable putting their kids in close-contact situations, on everyone from school principals to Gov. Eric Holcomb signing off, and on COVID-19 not getting out of control and shutting it all down midway through reopening. Now, repeat all of that 50 times over and you’ll have an idea of the scale of the challenge of getting high school sports started nationwide. IndyStar surveyed state directors in 30 states about the challenges of getting started, finding myriad situations with one bottom line: Nothing is for certain. As professional and college sports have begun to work toward a restart, testing has been among the biggest issues. Professional leagues wanted to wait until testing was widely available to the public, so they weren’t jumping in line, and to get back, it seems they’ll need to test participants with some degree of regularity. At the college level, Pac-12 commissioner Larry Scott said his conference will require student-athletes to undergo testing upon returning to campuses, though there’s variance across schools from other conferences. At the high school level, this will rarely be the case. “We discussed that,” David Hines, the executive director of the Arizona Interscholastic Association, said. “I don’t think we have the capability to require that.” The 16-page guidance document distributed by the NFHS in late May does not include recommendations for regular testing of student-athletes, despite asymptomatic spread of coronavirus accounting for up to 40 percent of transmission. That guidance recommends screening for signs and symptoms of coronavirus, including a temperature check, before  any workouts or contests, with records kept of those present in order to allow for contact tracing. “We will look at (testing) in conjunction with the Virginia Department of Health, and look and see if that’s a possibility, if that’s not a possibility,” said Billy Haun, the Virginia High School League’s executive director. “Because when you start talking about that level of stuff, you gotta look at, are there enough tests available to do that and what’s the expense that it’s gonna be that would be incurred by the local school divisions?” The commonly used PCR tests cost up to $200 each,, and most high schools won’t have the budget for that, especially amid the economic crisis brought on by the pandemic. In some states, schools might struggle to get the necessary protective equipment in order to stage workouts, practices and games, running into issues with the supply chain. As things start to open back up, most are optimistic about getting materials, but it could be a strain on budgets. “Have our coaches even really given a lot of thought to, do we have hand sanitizers? Well, you can’t even get hand sanitizer,” said Que Tucker, the executive director of North Carolina's High School Athletic Association. “Well do we have disinfectant wipes, so we can wipe off the sled once we finish pushing it around and the next individual is ready to go? How are we gonna wipe that down? Do we have the wipes?  “And those kinds of materials are in short supply.” If a player or coach tests positive for COVID-19, most states will take their cues from their state or county health departments, as well as the CDC. The CDC currently recommends that anyone who has had close contact with an individual who tests positive for the coronavirus stay home for 14 days following exposure. Of the states that did provide details of what a positive coronavirus test response would look like, contact tracing and testing was often a stipulation. So was immediately quarantining anyone who tests positive.  Jason West, head of communications for Missouri’s organization, said it could look like the policy that was in place for the state basketball championships before they were canceled:  If one person with a team has symptoms or a fever, that team could be automatically disqualified. In Alabama, where schools reopened, including athletic facilities, on June 1, they’ll follow guidance from the state’s department of education that includes closing off areas used by an infected person for up to 24 hours before cleaning and disinfecting. In Iowa, where summer baseball and softball leagues start games on June 15 with fans in attendance, a positive test will trigger a chain reaction from the school to Iowa’s department of public health, which can then start tracing and testing. Ultimately, plans are needed not just to avoid the virus, but to deal with it if it comes. Otherwise, even if seasons start, they may not finish, if entire teams must be in periodic 14-day quarantines. “One of the big concerns is just that integrity of communication,” said Bill Faflick, the executive director in Kansas. “A kid shouldn’t want to play football so badly or be in the marching band so terribly much that they would misrepresent symptoms and conditions that they were exposed to and potentially subject teammates and opponents.” Iowa, which will hold its summer high school baseball and softball leagues, is a good model to work from. Iowa’s guidance calls for daily symptom checks and for temperatures to be checked at home prior to athletes attending practices or games.  During practices, coaches are to ensure social distancing between players and only essential personnel are allowed on the field during games. Weight rooms are closed for now. Players are encouraged to bring their own equipment. Shared equipment is sanitized before and after games. Fans are allowed at games, with limited bleacher capacity and the use of personal chairs encouraged. Four schools have decided not to play, though individual athletes could reportedly play for other schools without penalty. “It’s been phrased to me this way on the radio, and I’m a little uncomfortable with it,” said Chris Cuellar, the state association’s communications director, “but we are kinda the guinea pig as far as high school sports goes for what can happen here.” As far as what Iowa’s success or failure means for other states, it’s impossible to know now. Playing baseball or softball is a different animal from football, the sport that has the most contact and often drives the most revenue. With most states reopening, most high school associations have plans to start getting back on the field at during the summer. For now, that means conditioning in small groups. That’s in part because kids generally haven’t been active since mid-March, when most states shut down, so they’ll need to build up before going full tilt. It’s also a way to enable social distancing, usually in an outdoor setting, to keep risk of transmission low. NFHS guidance recommends this sort of set up during phase 1, with no locker rooms used, equipment and surfaces disinfected after use and ample use of hand sanitizer. Regular screenings for symptoms and temperature checks will also be par for the course in most states. Eventually, though, if there is a season, that will have to turn into something resembling a normal practice. For most sports — football in particular — social distancing is all but impossible. Some states that already have limited contact periods for football practices feel prepared. But all will rely on coaches to be inventive. “Passing games — could social distancing become possible, yes? But no defensive backs,” said Jerry Snodgrass, executive director in Ohio. . “You’d have to snap from the shotgun. Things like that.” While pro leagues and colleges can at least conceive of playing without fans if necessary, doing so would be a last resort for most high schools, as nearly all the revenue comes from gate receipts. State organizations and schools haven’t decided  whether spectators will be allowed in, as there’s still time to decide that later. Rural states with spread-out populations that have seen less of the virus are optimistic. “You look at a football game in the fall, in a lot of our communities, you’re looking at a couple hundred fans,” said Dan Swartos, executive director in South Dakota. “So right now, we think that the facilities are in place to be able to provide that distancing and to hold our contests as planned.  “But if we need to make adjustments, we can.” When it comes to officials, who tend to be in an at-risk age group, some states expect problems filling slots, and have discussed ways of shrinking the number they need — such as moving from seven to five-man crews for football games. Other states, citing an uptick in officials during the 2008 financial crisis, expect the recession to make hiring easier. Few calendars have changed for the fall, but decision-makers in most states, say it could be a matter of time before they do. Some states have not  even announced whether schools will open in-person, remain online or use a hybrid model, as one district in West Bloomfield, Michigan, plans to do. In many cases, if a school is fully online, it makes sports a nonstarter.  “Normal is August 1 for fall sport practice to begin,” said Clark Wade, executive director of the Washington, D.C., athletic association, which will be one of the slowest places to return. “... I can tell you, that is not gonna be the normal this year.” To a person, everyone involved in high school athletics will tell you that money is a secondary concern — holding contests in a safe manner that allows kids to get the experience of playing comes first, even if it means losing money with no fans involved. But that doesn’t change the economic realities at play. Though most spring competitions, which were canceled across the board, don’t make much money, state organizations that lost some or all of their winter postseasons, particularly basketball tournaments, are already in the hole. Karissa Niehoff, the NFHS’ executive director, said losses ranged from $150,000 to $2 million across state athletic associations. Very few have cut jobs — of the 30 surveyed for this story, Ohio was the only one to say it had, laying off a receptionist and several part-time employees. But if fall seasons are affected, that could easily change. Most state organizations have taken out loans through the Paycheck Protection Program, as part of the CARES Act, to protect their employees, but those loans allow for only eight weeks of salary. In Indiana, the state organization has gotten by despite a $1 million loss, thanks to a rainy day fund it built over the years. But if the fall season is affected, things will change dramatically. “I think the association will be faced with some really difficult decisions at that point in time about how you continue,” Cox said. “Will you liquidate your investments and use those investments to keep going? Will you lay people off? Will you cut salaries? Will you furlough staff?” On the individual school level, no football will create the same kind of domino effect as with state organizations.  Football and basketball tend to pay for everything else. “You could have a situation where, especially some of our smaller schools, if they don’t have football, then it may mean they don’t have some of the other sports,” Tucker said. “… And once you start going down that path, then you run into the issues of Title IX, and, OK, if you’re not going to have this sport and it happens to be a girl’s sport, what are you doing for the guys?” Right now, though, everything is at the mercy of the virus.    "
23,23,Iowa State says 10 student-athletes have tested positive for coronavirusDavid Mullen ,9:56 p.m. ET Jun. 12,https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/college/2020/06/12/iowa-state-cyclones-positive-coronavirus-tests/3179814001/,"Ten Iowa State University student-athletes, including two Cyclones football players, have tested positive for coronavirus, the university's athletic department acknowledged Friday. The university revealed the number in a statement after Story County health board chairman Dr. John Paschen said he suspected the ISU athletics department was tied to a recent sharp rise in the county's confirmed coronavirus cases, according to an Ames Tribune story published Friday.   “While I cannot confirm this by any means, I’m suspicious that a lot of these cases are coming from ISU athletics, just because we’re getting printouts of ages and it makes the most sense to me,” Paschen said.  Also Friday, Steve Sullivan, a spokesperson for Mary Greeley Medical Center in Ames and Story County Public Health, said that over the past seven days, health officials have seen an increasing number of cases among individuals ages 20-25. “That (age range has) been the majority of the reported cases — at least half,"" Sullivan said. ""We haven’t seen these types of numbers in the 20-to-25 age range, and they began popping up at this level and rate within the last couple of weeks.” Iowa State athletics announced June 3 that a part-time student worker had tested positive for coronavirus. It also said that four student-athletes had been quarantined when they experienced COVID-like symptoms after having contact with an infected person outside the department. More:Houston suspends voluntary workouts after 6 student-athletes test positive for coronavirus Opinion:We might be seeing a wild, wild west of college football and coronavirus testing Friday's statement from Angie Hunt, ISU news service director, said none of the 10 student-athletes who tested positive for coronavirus was ""participating in team activities at the time they were exposed to COVID-19."" The statement said that since that exposure, ""all football team members returning to campus have been tested. Of the 147 players and staff tested, only two of the returning players have tested positive for COVID-19."" It added that the athletic department ""is taking a number of precautions and has protocols for contact tracing as well as isolation to limit the spread of illness.""  It also said that ""the university feels strongly about balancing the privacy of our student-athletes and being transparent as well as avoiding speculation on case numbers."" The statement did not outline any further action. Before ISU released a statement Friday, Iowa State Senior Associate Athletics Director Steve Malchow told a Tribune reporter that the department had nothing new to report about coronavirus. The call abruptly cut off when the reporter pressed for more details; Malchow later denied he had hung up.  Mike Green, assistant athletic director for communications, said he could neither confirm nor deny there were additional coronavirus cases in the department and said test results were expected this weekend or Monday. Paschen, contacted after the university released its statement, said it added to his concern that the university may not be doing enough to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. ""This is what keeps me up at night in regard to COVID, is ISU and students, and if Iowa State doesn't take a hard stance and say you can’t be in a class unless you have a mask, we’re going to get more of it,"" he said. He said he was encouraged to hear that the university is isolating the athletes who tested positive, ""but I wonder if they enforce it. That means they can’t practice together, they can’t work out together. .... I bet a bunch of them live together but if they’re all self-isolating for 14 days, hopefully they’re not going to the bars at night."" In a June 3 news release on the earlier confirmed case, ISU Athletic director Jamie Pollard said a coronavirus diagnosis in the department “is not a great surprise.” “The potential for infections and positive test results has always been very real for an organization like ours and we’ve been thorough and diligent in planning for such incidents,” Pollard said. “Our medical team, headed by Mark Coberley, has done a magnificent job in preparing protocols and procedures for countless scenarios related to the virus.” On Friday, the Iowa Department of Public Health reported 25 new cases of COVID-19 in Story County — the second time this week the county has recorded its highest number of cases for a single day. Friday's confirmed cases brought the county's total for the past seven days to 68, by far the most recorded in a single week. Story County has reported 205 confirmed cases since the pandemic began.

24,24,"More fans, fewer restrictions: Games go on Taiwan ballparks","Jun. 9, 2020",https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/2020/06/09/more-fans-fewer-restrictions-games-go-on-taiwan-ballparks/111939946/,"NEW TAIPEI CITY, Taiwan (AP) — The Taiwan baseball league is continuing as a trailblazer for sports resuming after the lockdown in the coronavirus pandemic. An easing last weekend allows more fans at the ballparks, allows them to sit closer together and consume food and drinks while they’re supporting their teams in the Taiwan-based CPBL. Masks are optional, when seated. The Taiwan league resumed play in April in empty stadiums while elite sports globally were still in lockdown, and last month started allowing up to 1,000 fans to attend games under strict social distancing measures. On Sunday, after the government again loosened its COVID-19 restrictions, fans were only required to wear surgical face masks when they weren’t in their seats, and the stadiums were allowed to be up to 50% full of fans. The CPBL is continuing to observe limited social distancing by ordering a one-seat gap be maintained between fans. The lifting of restrictions was welcomed at Tuesday’s game between the defending CPBL champion Rakutan Monkeys and the visiting Uni-Lions in Tainan. Monkeys fan Martha Chen said she could now cheer as much as she wants without a mask. The Uni-Lions held off a ninth inning rally to beat the defending CPBL champions 7-6. “From now on, we don’t have to wear a mask when we watch a baseball game at the stadium. This allows me to shout out loud as much as I want to cheer for my team,” the 31-year-old Chen, an air transport worker, said. “And my kid would not bother me with taking the mask off. Kids find it hard to wear a mask.” Uni-Lions pitcher Logan Darnell said the easing of restrictions on fans made it feel “a lot more like a baseball game”. “Everybody is excited that there’s less restrictions on the fans coming in. They make us feel a lot more normal than what is was beforehand,"" Darnell said. ""You had a certain amount of people that can come in, and everybody was spread out. And even before that, when there was nobody in the stands, that was just a different ... different feel. But now that everybody is back and the restrictions are kind of less, it’s going feel a lot more like a baseball game for sure.” Taiwan, which has had 433 COVID-19 cases among a population of 23 million, limited the spread by imposing flight restrictions and through contact tracing of anyone who comes near a confirmed patient. Elite sports leagues are gradually resumed in some countries, mostly without fans in stadiums or with very small crowds under strict physical distancing restrictions. ___ More AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports"
25,25,"An 'alarming' exodus: public health officials fighting coronavirus depart amid growing threats, nonstop workMichelle R. Smith, Lauren Weber and Anna Maria Barry-Jester ",10:19 a.m. ET Jun. 13,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2020/06/13/public-health-workers-fighting-coronavirus-face-growing-threats/3182000001/,"Emily Brown was stretched thin. As the director of the Rio Grande County Public Health Department in rural Colorado, she was working 12- and 14-hour days, struggling to respond to the pandemic with only five full-time employees for more than 11,000 residents. Case counts were rising. She was already at odds with county commissioners, who were pushing to loosen public health restrictions in late May, against her advice. She had previously clashed with them over data releases and control and had haggled over a variance regarding reopening businesses. But she reasoned that standing up for public health principles was worth it, even if she risked losing the job that allowed her to live close to her hometown and help her parents with their farm. Then came the Facebook post: a photo of her and other health officials with comments about their weight and references to “armed citizens” and “bodies swinging from trees.” The commissioners had asked her to meet with them the next day. She intended to ask them for more support. Instead, she was fired. “They finally were tired of me not going along the line they wanted me to go along,” she said. In the battle against COVID-19, public health workers spread across states, cities and small towns make up an invisible army on the front lines. But that army, which has suffered neglect for decades, is under assault when it’s needed most. Officials who usually work behind the scenes managing tasks like immunizations and water quality inspections have found themselves center stage. Elected officials and members of the public who are frustrated with the lockdowns and safety restrictions have at times turned public health workers into politicized punching bags, battering them with countless angry calls and even physical threats. On Thursday, Ohio’s state health director, who had armed protesters come to her house, resigned. The health officer for Orange County, California, quit Monday after weeks of criticism and personal threats from residents and other public officials over an order requiring face coverings in public. As the pressure and scrutiny rise, many more health officials have chosen to leave or have been pushed out of their jobs. A review by Kaiser Health News and The Associated Press finds at least 27 state and local health leaders have resigned, retired or been fired since April across 13 states. From North Carolina to California, they have left their posts because of a mix of backlash and stressful, nonstop work, all while dealing with chronic staffing and funding shortages. Some health officials have not been up to the job during the biggest health crisis in a century. Others previously had plans to leave or cited their own health issues. But Lori Tremmel Freeman, CEO of the National Association of County and City Health Officials, said the majority of what she calls an “alarming” exodus resulted from increasing pressure as states reopen. Three of those 27 were members of her board and well known in the public health community — Rio Grande County’s Brown; Detroit’s senior public health adviser, Dr. Kanzoni Asabigi; and the head of North Carolina’s Gaston County Department of Health and Human Services, Chris Dobbins. Asabigi’s sudden retirement, considering his stature in the public health community, shocked Freeman. She also was upset to hear about the departure of Dobbins, who was chosen as health director of the year for North Carolina in 2017. Asabigi and Dobbins did not reply to requests for comment. “They just don’t leave like that,” Freeman said. Public health officials are “really getting tired of the ongoing pressures and the blame game,” Freeman said. She warned that more departures could be expected in the coming days and weeks as political pressure trickles down from the federal to the state to the local level. From the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, federal public health officials have complained of being sidelined or politicized. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been marginalized; a government whistleblower said he faced retaliation because he opposed a White House directive to allow widespread access to the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine as a COVID-19 treatment. In Hawaii, Democratic congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard called on the governor to fire his top public health officials, saying she believed they were too slow on testing, contact tracing and travel restrictions. In Wisconsin, several Republican lawmakers have repeatedly demanded that the state’s health services secretary resign, and the state’s conservative Supreme Court ruled 4-3 that she had exceeded her authority by extending a stay-at-home order. With the increased public scrutiny, security details — like those seen on a federal level for Dr. Anthony Fauci, the top infectious-disease expert — have been assigned to top state health officials, including Georgia’s Dr. Kathleen Toomey after she was threatened. Ohio’s Dr. Amy Acton, who also had a security detail assigned after armed protesters showed up at her home, resigned Thursday. In Orange County, in late May, nearly 100 people attended a county supervisors meeting, waiting hours to speak against an order requiring face coverings. One person suggested that the order might make it necessary to invoke Second Amendment rights to bear arms, while another read aloud the home address of the order’s author, the county’s chief health officer, Dr. Nichole Quick, as well as the name of her boyfriend. Quick, attending by phone, left the meeting. In a statement, the sheriff’s office later said Quick had expressed concern for her safety following “several threatening statements both in public comment and online.” She was given personal protection by the sheriff. But Monday, after yet another public meeting that included criticism from members of the board of supervisors, Quick resigned. She could not be reached for comment. Earlier, the county’s deputy director of public health services, David Souleles, retired abruptly. An official in another California county also has been given a security detail, said Kat DeBurgh, the executive director of the Health Officers Association of California, declining to name the county or official because the threats have not been made public. Many local health leaders, accustomed to relative anonymity as they work to protect the public’s health, have been shocked by the growing threats, said Theresa Anselmo, the executive director of the Colorado Association of Local Public Health Officials. After polling local health directors across the state at a meeting last month, Anselmo found about 80% said they or their personal property had been threatened since the pandemic began. About 80% also said they’d encountered threats to pull funding from their department or other forms of political pressure. To Anselmo, the ugly politics and threats are a result of the politicization of the pandemic from the start. So far in Colorado, six top local health officials have retired, resigned or been fired. A handful of state and local health department staff members have left as well, she said. “It’s just appalling that in this country that spends as much as we do on health care that we’re facing these really difficult ethical dilemmas: Do I stay in my job and risk threats, or do I leave because it’s not worth it?” Anselmo asked. In California, senior health officials from seven counties, including Quick and Souleles, have resigned or retired since March 15. Dr. Charity Dean, the second in command at the state Department of Public Health, submitted her resignation June 4. Burnout seems to be contributing to many of those decisions, DeBurgh said. In addition to the harm to current officers, DeBurgh is worried about the impact these events will have on recruiting people into public health leadership. “It’s disheartening to see people who disagree with the order go from attacking the order to attacking the officer to questioning their motivation, expertise and patriotism,” said DeBurgh. “That’s not something that should ever happen.” Some of the online abuse has been going on for years, said Bill Snook, a spokesperson for the health department in Kansas City, Missouri. He has seen instances in which people took a health inspector’s name and made a meme out of it, or said a health worker should be strung up or killed. He said opponents of vaccinations, known as anti-vaxxers, have called staffers “baby killers.” The pandemic, though, has brought such behavior to another level. In Ohio, the Delaware General Health District has had two lockdowns since the pandemic began — one after an angry individual came to the health department. Fortunately, the doors were locked, said Dustin Kent, program manager for the department’s residential services unit. Angry calls over contact tracing continue to pour in, Kent said. In Colorado, the Tri-County Health Department, which serves Adams, Arapahoe and Douglas counties near Denver, has also been getting hundreds of calls and emails from frustrated citizens, deputy director Jennifer Ludwig said. Some have been angry their businesses could not open and blamed the health department for depriving them of their livelihood. Others were furious with neighbors who were not wearing masks outside. It’s a constant wave of “confusion and angst and anxiety and anger,” she said. Then in April and May, rocks were thrown at one of their office’s windows — three separate times. The office was tagged with obscene graffiti. The department also received an email calling members of the department “tyrants,” adding “you’re about to start a hot-shooting ... civil war.” Health department workers decamped to another office. Although the police determined there was no imminent threat, Ludwig stressed how proud she was of her staff, who weathered the pressure while working round-the-clock. “It does wear on you, but at the same time, we know what we need to do to keep moving to keep our community safe,” she said. “Despite the complaints, the grievances, the threats, the vandalism — the staff have really excelled and stood up.” The threats didn’t end there, however: Someone asked on the health department’s Facebook page how many people would like to know the home addresses of the Tri-County Health Department leadership. “You want to make this a war??? No problem,” the poster wrote. Back in Colorado’s Rio Grande County, some members of the community have rallied in support of Brown with public comments and a letter to the editor of a local paper. Meanwhile, COVID-19 case counts have jumped from 14 to 49 as of Wednesday. Brown is grappling with what she should do next: Dive back into another strenuous public health job in a pandemic or take a moment to recoup? When she told her 6-year-old son she no longer had a job, he responded: “Good, now you can spend more time with us.” Michelle R.

26,26,Coronavirus phone tracing by Apple and Google could help America reopenThe Editorial Board ,"Apr. 22, 2020",https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/todaysdebate/2020/04/21/coronavirus-tracing-app-apple-google-help-america-reopen-editorials-debates/5152292002/,"As the United States eases out of a painful, job-killing phase of social distancing and sheltering at home, preventing the new coronavirus from roaring back will require shattering infection chains as rapidly as they reemerge. This means identifying new infections so the sick are treated and their contacts quickly isolated. Ensuring success might also mean embracing digital surveillance technology, despite privacy risks. Some nations are already using data collection, with aggressive testing and contact tracing, to manage COVID-19 without the same level of death and economic ruin the United States has endured. China's autocratic regime requires citizens to use smartphone software that rates their infection risk with color codes and shares that information with police; the government also runs facial-recognition scans via publicly located cameras to monitor those who are supposed to be quarantined.  Passengers arriving in South Korea, a democracy, are required to download a self-diagnosis app. And Seoul uses cellphone data, credit card transactions and security footage to track the movements of COVID-19 patients, making details public with addresses — but without names — in order to alert people and learn who else is infected. This kind of privacy infringement wouldn't be tolerated in the United States, where citizens grew angry when the government collected telephone records after 9/11 in the name of counterterrorism. But China and South Korea now have coronavirus death rates  — 3.3 per million and 4.6 per million residents, respectively — that are tiny fractions of the 130 deaths per million among Americans. As the United States works toward reopening its economy, is there something between Big Brother surveillance and nothing at all? Something that could help guard against a deadly virus relapse? A joint effort by Apple and Google shows promise. The companies have developed software technology that allows iPhone and Android devices new ways to swap data. Phone users would have to voluntarily enlist in this program by downloading an app from their local health care authority. Once installed, their smartphone would use short-distance Bluetooth technology to track all nearby contacts with other people who elected to use the same technology. LAURENCE TRIBE:Don’t barter away our enduring liberties The data would be stored on each individual phone and include no names or location information, only a ""key"" identifier exclusive to each nearby contact. These identifiers would be rotated on a randomized basis to prevent long-term tracking. If a smartphone user fell sick with the novel coronavirus, they'd be diagnosed by their health authority and report this in the app. The iOS and Android devices of other people participating in the program would download these reports and look for a match to see whether they had been in contact with a coronavirus victim. The whole idea would be to trace and alert those who might also be infected, with the aim of cutting any COVID-19 infection chain. This still is a sort of surveillance, although more palatable because of greater reliance on anonymity and voluntarism. And the promise of privacy protection carries added weight because of participation by Apple, which has a demonstrated history of refusing government demands for data. Moreover, without a system like this, contact tracers by the thousands will have to rely solely on the memory of ailing COVID-19 patients to learn who else might be infected. For this Apple/Google idea to work — it's to be rolled out by mid-May — many will have to choose it. California has been out front on coronavirus measures, and Gov. Gavin Newsom said this month that his government is exploring the tech giants' concept. Its effectiveness hinges on participation. Similar voluntary tracking software offered in Singapore and Iceland attracted only 20% to 40% of smartphone users, and epidemiologists believe 60% is the necessary threshold. Americans have already shown a willingness to act in unity against coronavirus by staying home and maintaining social distances in numbers large enough to bring down rates of infection. The question will be whether they can show the same consensus when it comes to keeping the disease away.    If you can't see this reader poll, please refresh your page.

28,28,Fact check: Bill Gates has given over $50 billion to charitable causes over careerMatthew Brown ,5:51 p.m. ET Jun. 12,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2020/06/11/fact-check-bill-gates-has-given-over-50-billion-charitable-causes/3169864001/,"Bill Gates is a consistent target of conspiracy theories, many becoming especially heightened amid the coronavirus pandemic. While the tech billionaire remains the target of scorn and suspicion online, others defend Gates, citing his history of charitable contributions. One viral post imagines Gates’ view of the current conspiracies, writing that the billionaire has spent “30 years"" of his life and ""$50 billion"" of his net worth ""supporting humanitarian causes.” The post, which has garnered 36,000 shares and 20,000 comments, criticizes conspiracy theorists in harsh terms for their claims, asserting that Gates has ""arguably"" done “more to better life on earth for humanity than any other human being to ever live.” Gates is a noted philanthropist and has pledged a significant amount of money to research and charitable causes during the coronavirus pandemic. He has given more than $50 billion to charity since 1994. However, his wealth has grown even faster than he has donated money. As of June 2020, Gates’ net worth was estimated at roughly than $110 billion, according to Forbes. More:Bill Gates is not secretly plotting microchips in a coronavirus vaccine. Misinformation and conspiracy theories are dangerous for everyone. Bill Gates, who has been one of the wealthiest men in the world for decades, made his fortune as the co-founder of Microsoft. The company, which was a key player the personal computer revolution in the 1990s, eventually became a corporate behemoth, and Gates became a household name as a tech titan and business magnate. Gates stepped down as Microsoft CEO in January 2000, shifting his attention to philanthropy and other assorted projects. In March 2020, Gates stepped down from Microsoft’s board, though he maintains about 1.3% of shares in the company. In 2010, Bill and Melinda Gates, alongside billionaire investor Warren Buffett, founded the “Giving Pledge,” a movement encouraging other billionaires to donate most of their wealth to charity . The voluntary group now includes more than 200 families and individuals from more than 20 countries. More:Fact check: Bill Gates did not craft contact tracing bill Bill and Melinda Gates have given $45.5 billion to charitable causes, including the eponymously named Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, since 1994, CNBC reported, citing the Chronicle of Philanthropy.  In 2019, the couple donated $589 million to charity, making them the seventh most philanthropic people last year. Since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, the Gates family has pledged billions of dollars in donations and funding for efforts to fight the virus. Some of these efforts have come under scrutiny, both from regulators and conspiracy theorists who assert that Gates has malicious intentions behind the giving. Despite these significant contributions and pledges, Gates remains one of the wealthiest people in the world. From 2000-07 Bill Gates was the richest man in the world and rotated that title with Buffett and Mexican telecommunications tycoon Carlos Slim from 2008-13. In 2018, Gates lost the title to Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. He remains the second richest man in the world, according to Forbes. Like many high net-worth individuals, Gates manages his wealth through an investment and holding company known as Cascade Investment LLC. The company maintains a diverse portfolio of investments and assets that account for more than half of Gates’ wealth.  Gates’ remaining 1% stake in Microsoft as of June is worth more than $7 billion, while the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation maintains over $50 billion in assets that can be counted among the couple’s net worth. Gates has maintained this fortune both through wealth management, as well as investments in the industry that first made him rich: technology. He is not unique among tech billionaires in this way. “By the end of 2018, tech billionaires’ assets totaled USD 1.3 trillion. Their net wealth has almost doubled over five years, growing by 91.4%,” a 2019 report on global billionaire wealth from the investment bank UBS and consulting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers found. “Many of their businesses are phenomenal cash generators. Software, internet and electronic equipment billionaires still account for 62.2% of tech wealth,” the report also said; software, internet and electronic equipment are the consumer products which Microsoft dominated under Gates’ leadership and remains a leader in today. Gates’ wealth is also tied up in luxury assets, which he has purchased over the years. Gates’ home, which he’s dubbed “Xanadu 2.0” as a reference to the movie Citizen Kane, was estimated to be worth $127.48 million in 2017. Xanadu 2.0 also holds the Gates family’s large car collection and a $130 million art collection including a Leonardo da Vinci manuscript. The family also has a private jet worth almost $20 million and owns a private tropical island in Belize called Grand Bogue Caye, valued at about $25 million. Bill Gates has been a consistent philanthropist for decades. He has remained extremely wealthy while giving away large amounts of his net worth through steady increases in his financial portfolio.

29,29,Can cleaning tech make people feel safe at hotels amid the coronavirus pandemic?Linda Laban ,"Jun. 8, 2020",https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/hotels/2020/06/08/hotel-room-cleaning-tech-other-measures-boosted-fight-coronavirus/5282082002/,"Understandably, people are nervous about leaving their homes for groceries or for a stroll, let alone traveling and staying in a hotel. But as confinement restrictions ease, many are itching to have a getaway. And, after the unprecedented global spring shutdown due to the coronavirus pandemic left millions of hotel rooms empty, the hotel industry is making all efforts to gain public trust and rebuild business. Certainly, hotel cleaning protocols top that list and will be highly visible. Hoteliers want guests to see their efforts and feel confident and are promising deep cleaning,  enhanced cleaning, and retraining staff on proper cleaning techniques – even down to disinfecting key cards.  But some are adding second-level super cleaning to their daily housekeeping. What is a 'deep clean'? Many businesses promise to them before reopening Troutbeck, a historic retreat set on 250 acres in New York’s Hudson Valley, flew into action during its closure, upgrading all of the resort’s HVAC systems with a new HEPA filtration system that includes UV light for extra germ-fighting. “It is a medical-grade system with something like a 97% kill rate of airborne viruses and bacteria,” says Troutbeck’s owner, Anthony Champalimaud. “It’s also really good at eliminating odors, which is always nice,” he adds. Retrofitting the system is in addition to implementing new protocols and increased staff training. “We underwent a rigorous adjustment,” Champalimaud says. “Before, our managers were ServSafe trained, but now all restaurant and bar staff are,” he added. Far-UVC sanitation, contact tracing:Tech cruise ships could implement to combat spread of coronavirus Many hotels are adding electrostatic disinfectant sprayers that allow for 360-degree surface coverage. Also, because the particles in the spray are positively charged, the cleaning solution adheres to surfaces, smothering and eradicating germs.   “In addition to following all industry protocols and standards, we’ve introduced a number of enhanced cleaning and sanitization measures to help ensure a safe environment for our staff and guests,” said John Lombardo, general manager of the privately-owned Saybrook Point Resort & Marina in Old Saybrook, Connecticut. “We’re using electrostatic sprayer technology that’s been adopted by some of the world’s largest hotel chains and airlines to apply disinfectants. It helps the product to surround and cling to surfaces in ways traditional cleaning measures can’t.” Saybrook Point Resort uses equipment from Victory Sprayers, whose website promises, “an eco-friendly approach to disinfection by spraying up to 65% less chemicals per square foot,” something that’s important to the waterside resort’s owners. Some New England properties in the Ocean House Management Collection will add Molekule plug-in virus zappers, which use nanotechnology to destroy pollutants, including mold, viruses and bacteria. “The Molekule devices provide an added layer of protection to both our staff and our guests,” says Daniel Hostettler, president and group managing director. “We'll have Molekule devices in all 49 guest rooms and 20 signature suites at the Ocean House, as well as all 31 guest rooms and four signature suites at Weekapaug Inn,” he said of the two properties that will add them before reopening in June.  In Texas, the Westin Houston Medical Center hotel sprang into immediate action in March, adding two virus-zapping robots. Used in hospitals, the LightStrike Germ-Zapping Robots, made by San Antonio-based Xenex Disinfection Services and costing about $100,000 each, emit broad-spectrum ultraviolet light to destroy viruses and bacteria within minutes. They do not replace the hotel’s regular cleaning: they go in afterward and provide a super-sterilizing second blast without added chemical risk. “On one level, we have given everything a deep clean and increased the frequency of cleaning the public areas, but we further enhanced our routine by adding the two robots,” says Archit Sanghvi, vice president of operations for Pearl Hospitality, which owns and operates this Westin franchise. Direct exposure to general UV light is dangerous to human tissue, so, after set-up, the robots work alone, overnight in the public areas and also in each guest room after checkout. “It is an expensive investment,” Sanghvi adds, “but we know we made the right decision because this is going to be the norm, sadly.” Federal health officials have prepared a battery of guidelines. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provides a list of best practices for preventing the spread of COVID-19. The EPA has listed over 300 cleaning products that are safe for humans but effective disinfectants against the SARS-CoV-2 virus. But really, ""it’s virgin territory for everyone,"" says Brad Rush, owner of Jan-Pro of Atlanta, whose employees clean a wide variety of buildings, from offices to fitness centers, schools and stores.  Vetted products do not guarantee the disappearance of the coronavirus, but they can ""help to reduce the chances of its transmission, especially from surfaces that people frequently make contact with,"" added Ogbonnaya Omenka, a public health expert and assistant professor at Butler University.

30,30,George Floyd protests create risk of deadly coronavirus resurgenceDr. Marc Siegel ,"Jun. 11, 2020",https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2020/06/08/george-floyd-protests-masks-coronavirus-resurgence-column/3147745001/,"Facial coverings have been used as a political Band-Aid in the fight against COVID-19, most recently this past week when mayors and governors across the country suddenly realized that the thronging mobs of demonstrators were, of course, not following rules of social distancing. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, for one, began to have masks distributed to the protesters.  Unfortunately, the absence of social distancing during the protests could lead to a significant increase in cases — masks or no masks — not just in Minnesota, which has seen a decrease to seven new cases on June 2, but around the country. We could see a new wave of cases a week from now, after the incubation period for most patients. The Associated Press reports that major demonstrations have taken place in 25 COVID-19 hot spots, including Minneapolis-St. Paul, Los Angeles, Washington D.C., Chicago and New York. Public health officials are all keeping a nervous eye on these areas.  Don’t get me wrong, masks are useful in the fight against any respiratory virus, and a new review from the World Health Organization suggests that they are effective at reducing COVID-19 spread, based on limited evidence. Still, I believe they are playing too prominent a role, all of a sudden. Dr. Jay Butler, deputy director on infectious diseases at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and incident manager of the COVID-19 response, says cloth face coverings are useful to help in what he calls “source control,” with the goal of decreasing the amount of circulating virus in a community. He acknowledges in an interview with me that there is a lot of asymptomatic spread, and that the virus has been found to be present in the nose of asymptomatic carriers. “Cloth face coverings may slow the spread of the virus and help people who may have the virus and do not know it from transmitting it to others,” he says. Making traces:I'm a coronavirus contact tracer. Asking vulnerable people to stay home isn't always easy. Nonetheless, masks or facial coverings are no alternative for true social distancing, especially when you consider that some studies have shown that respiratory droplets can escape a mask, not to mention the fact that the use of facial coverings to prevent asymptomatic spread of COVID-19 has never been studied. Plus, when people are upset, distracted or agitated the way they are at a demonstration or protest, they may rub their face and mask unconsciously, discard them improperly or reuse an old dirty one that collects virus. Keep in mind, as I wrote in “False Alarm: The Truth About the Epidemic of Fear,” people who are frightened, angry or passionate tend to take fewer precautions. You are more likely to be spitting over a half-dangling mask when you speak in anger. You are far more likely to be spreading virus if you are indeed infected. So much has been made of mask wearing, too many people who wear them wrongly think that’s all they have to do to protect themselves from COVID-19. Our state and local leaders have been inconsistent, pivoting from draconian warnings about violating lockdowns to no mention of COVID-19 at all, while showing sympathy for the protesters. It does little to inspire public confidence if you are warning against going to church one week while supporting public gatherings the next, as so many of our state and local leaders have done. Indeed, with riots in major cities throughout the country, COVID-19 has too often disappeared from the public discourse. Distributing masks as a gesture to an angry public is hardly the way to continue the fight against a deadly, highly contagious virus. Much more needs to be done. Coronavirus recovery hospital:Ravaged bodies, fearful patients, unpredictable fates With many states of the country engaged in various stages of reopening, now is not the time for another viral setback. Keep in mind that many of the people protesting the terrible death of George Floyd are in disadvantaged socioeconomic groups at higher risks for acquiring and having complications from COVID-19, in part because of preexisting conditions and in part because of inadequate access to health care. A mask is a little more than a public health Band-Aid to these disadvantaged people. We need to help them access the prevention strategies and treatments they desperately need.  Our illness as a society goes beyond COVID-19 to the core problem of health care disparity. The anger is deeply rooted. We can’t mask the problem or cover over it any longer. We must face it head on in order to begin to heal.

31,31,Digital coronavirus data tracing would barter away American liberties: Laurence TribeLaurence H. Tribe ,"Apr. 22, 2020",https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/todaysdebate/2020/04/21/coronavirus-data-tracing-barter-away-liberties-laurence-tribe-editorials-debates/3000576001/,"The benefits of the data-driven coronavirus tracing programs are immediate and tangible. The costs are more abstract and uncertain. But by trading abstract harms for short-term gain, we risk permanently damaging the fabric of our society. Reopening our economy and society will require revealing more about ourselves than ever before. Knowing who can safely reenter public spaces demands extensive contagion testing, contact tracing and sharing medical information long deemed “private.” Especially for the digital generation, that might seem a low price to pay for greater normalcy. But history teaches us to beware such bargains. They can permanently transform us in ways we will come to regret, as we drift over a “privacy horizon” from which we might never return. Paradoxically, privacy is a public value. It begins with personal choices about what individuals share, and with whom. But the cumulative impact of those judgments far exceeds the sum of their parts. Just as decisions about liberty of speech shape not only personal expression but the vibrancy and openness of society as a whole, so too do decisions about privacy shape the character of the community. Behavior differs in subtle ways in a world where walls have eyes, where everyone is an involuntary voyeur and intimate information is no longer ours to control. Immerse that reality in a thoroughly digitized world, and society is transformed. OUR VIEW:Apple/Google phone tracing could help America reopen Promises of limited access or nonindividualization provide little solace. Once compiled, data can be misappropriated in too many ways to predict — by opportunists and identity thieves, “trustworthy” companies, friendly and unfriendly governments. Even in the anonymized aggregate, data can be deployed in damaging ways: Medical, pricing and advertising algorithms already produce disturbing discriminatory effects. And legal remedies, both judicial and administrative, have often proved inadequate or nonexistent. Adding intensely private medical information to that stew risks exacerbating existing problems. As trying as this virus is, we mustn’t hastily barter away our enduring liberties for fleeting relief. At stake is nothing less than the soul of our society and the character of the future we’re toiling so tirelessly to ensure. Laurence H. Tribe, the Carl M.

32,32,"Opinion: We might be seeing a wild, wild west of college football and coronavirus testing","Jun. 12, 2020",https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/columnist/dan-wolken/2020/06/12/college-football-faces-many-coronavirus-questions/5344995002/,"As college football players have returned to campus for voluntary workouts this month, we’ve seen a parade of announcements from athletic departments about how many athletes have tested positive for COVID-19 during re-entry. While some people would interpret the data as concerning when positive tests do pop up, the reality is that schools are making these announcements public because it shows that their screening procedures are working. ""It gives us a great baseline moving forward,"" said one athletics director who spoke to USA TODAY Sports on the condition of anonymity due to the sensitive nature of the topic. But the question of whether these testing disclosures will continue — including the frequency, the specificity and the implications for the season if players and staff are forced to miss games — is one that is yet to be fully addressed on a national or even conference level even though the implications this fall reach all the way from campus/public health information to sports gambling. ""I don’t believe universities will necessarily take the approach of doing a daily debrief or periodically updating their number of cases,"" said Tory Lindley, the president of the National Athletic Trainers Association and the head of the athletic training department at Northwestern. NEW LOOK:Emmert says college football in 2020 could be dramatically different MICHIGAN MAN:Is Jim Harbaugh the ""most overrated coach in the country""? IOWA UNREST:As accusations pile up, Kirk Ferentz ill-equipped to lead change And it appears they won’t have to, as disclosure of injuries and illness is an issue the NCAA and conference offices have typically stayed away from any type of standardization. But unlike the inconsistency from one school to another in announcing sprained ankles or hip flexors, COVID-19 is a new and sensitive issue. It’s also potentially a competitive issue. Though the statistics suggest the vast majority of players will be asymptomatic or have mild symptoms, we don’t really know how easy or difficult it will be to contain an outbreak on a team once practice starts and players are in close contact to one another. Administrators are concerned that the most likely way it would spread is through a position group, so if a defensive lineman tests positive, would a significant number of players at that same position be in peril of not playing in the upcoming game that weekend? And if so, is it unfair to opponents, fans and gamblers if one team announces every Wednesday that they have four positive tests and another has positive tests but doesn’t announce anything? Meanwhile, schools will have to operate in this environment while adhering to the strict laws of medical privacy but also knowing that any player or coach who isn’t on the sideline or at practice is likely going to be presumed COVID-19 positive if there’s no other reason given for their absence. And given the potential stigma around this new virus and the contact tracing implications, is that fair for the public to presume a player has COVID-19 if they actually just have the flu? ""Some of it goes back to (programs’) common practices in the past of what they disclose and when they disclose it,"" Lindley said. ""It goes back to availability and you may not know why, but you’ll know if someone is unavailable for participation and there will be variance from institution to institution of how much they share and how much is simply to protect the student-athlete for a lot of reasons. Maybe an undisclosed illness or issue or injury — or they're just listed as out and there’s no reason given."" Given all the issues athletic departments have been dealing with over the last few months, how they’ll deal with disclosure of positive tests once the season gets going has not been high on the list. On a Zoom call with reporters earlier this week, Notre Dame coach Brian Kelly suggested he hadn’t even thought about it at all and passed the issue off to his sports information director. Arkansas State athletics director Terry Mohajir, whose school was one of the first to announce that athletes had tested positive during their re-entry protocol (there were seven positives across all sports), said it’s possible they would continue announcing numbers of positive tests. He added, though, that he did not foresee many schools disclosing significant amounts of information aside from what’s required to the local health authorities and campus emergency management teams. ""I don’t ever foresee us as an institution specifically talking publicly about an individual that has tested positive for COVID,"" Mohajir said. Another athletics director, who asked not to be identified publicly because the school’s policy had not been set in stone yet, said they’re considering just issuing a weekly report on number of positive tests for the sake of consistency and not to raise suspicions that they’re trying to hide numbers whether they’re good or bad. That’s already been an issue at Alabama, for example, where the BamaInsider publication reported “as many as five” positive cases on the football team. The school later put out a statement that neither confirmed nor denied the report, citing privacy laws. As individual conferences formulate their in-season policies for testing during game weeks, at least three identified by USA TODAY Sports are discussing some type of procedure where teams would inform each other before the game if players are unavailable due to COVID-19. But there’s a clear downside to that: Once information gets exchanged, it’s almost certain to leak. It will also be rumor fuel, whether true or not. Such information could even be weaponized in recruiting. Say, hypothetically, a player is planning a visit for a Saturday game against another school that’s recruiting him. If the visiting team learns that the home team has multiple positive cases, would that staff be above suggesting to the recruit that maybe it’s not a great weekend to be on that campus?  These are among the issues and unintended consequences of COVID-19 that college athletics has yet to reckon with as the countdown to the season begins in earnest. And yet, unless the NCAA steps in and provides some guidelines around how much information schools are supposed to release around positive tests, it’s likely to devolve into the wild, wild west.

""We came up with this concept of a 54-match tournament similar to the very successful World Cup here in 1994 where only 24 nations competed,"" said Garber. ""Each team will have a minimum of three games in the group stage. Those results will count for the 2020 MLS season standings and that will continue when we're able to continue our season when we're back in our home markets."" Garber was asked numerous times Wednesday how the league will handle safety and medical issues regarding COVID-19.  As for the testing protocol, during an individual's first two weeks in Orlando, that person will be tested every other day. After those first 14 days, players, coaches and referees will be tested regularly, including the day before each matchday.  ""I think guys feel reasonably comfortable with it. I think some of the protocols have been well thought out,"" FC Cincinnati goalkeeper Spencer Richey said.  Self-temperature screenings and the completion of standardized screening questionnaires will be required for all individuals traveling to the ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex or providing services at the hotel and convention center where MLS league and club personnel will be staying. A positive response to the daily questionnaire or a temperature check above 100.3 degrees must be reported and the individual in question will be isolated immediately and PCR testing will be performed. With facemasks, PPE, social distancing and temperature screenings, Garber said he's confident they'll be able to manage the tournament safely. Garber was asked if there's a number of positive tests that would halt or suspend the tournament. ""No specific protocol for how many positive tests would have us take a step back and think about what happens next,"" Garber said. ""It's why we're so focused on regular testing and ensuring that we do what we need to do to keep our players safe and managing what would happen should a player test positive."" A positive test from a player would mean that player is removed from the tournament and placed in quarantine, then contact tracing would be done for those that were in contact within 10 feet of that person. A draw for the tournament will be held Thursday to determine the six groups. For the remainder of the season, Nashville SC will be moved to the Eastern Conference. The Eastern Conference will have three groups, one consisting of six teams and two consisting of four teams each. The Western Conference will have three groups, each consisting of four teams. As the host club, Orlando City SC will be given the top seed in Group A, which will be the six-team group, and will play in the first match on July 8.  The five remaining seeds will consist of the four semifinalists from the 2019 MLS Cup Playoffs – Atlanta United, Los Angeles Football Club, Seattle Sounders FC, Toronto FC – and Real Salt Lake (the team with the next highest points total in the Western Conference from the 2019 season).  The seeded teams will be drawn into their respective groups first and then the remaining 20 clubs will be drawn and distributed across the conference-based groups. After the MLS is Back Tournament, MLS plans to continue its regular season with a revised schedule in home markets, followed by the Audi MLS Cup Playoffs and the 25th MLS Cup. The schedule will be developed at a later date. "
34,34,2 more Oklahoma St football players positive for COVID-19,"Jun. 3, 2020",https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaf/2020/06/03/2-more-oklahoma-st-football-players-positive-for-covid-19/111904166/,"STILLWATER, Okla. (AP) — Two more Oklahoma State football players have tested positive for COVID-19 since returning to campus for voluntary workouts, bringing the total to three. Senior associate athletic director Kevin Klintworth wrote on his Twitter account Wednesday that of the 150 staff, administrators and athletes tested, three athletes had asymptomatic positives. Linebacker Amen Ogbongbemiga announced Tuesday he tested positive after he attended a protest in Tulsa, Oklahoma. The other two players were not identified. “Positives were expected and the plan for that scenario has been activated,"" Klintworth wrote. “We will be as forthcoming as possible on the covid issues."" OSU spokesman Gavin Lang said there would be no additional comment. Marshall University in West Virginia announced Monday two of its football players and one staff member tested positive. Iowa State said Wednesday a student worker in its athletic department tested positive and that four athletes were showing symptoms and awaiting test results. The three positives at Oklahoma State come two months after Cowboys coach Mike Gundy was criticized for being insensitive in comments about the nation's response to the pandemic. He referenced the financial impact of football while suggesting players should return to campus as early as May 1. “They’re in good shape, they’re all 18, 19, 20, 21, 22 years old, they’re healthy,"" Gundy said April 7. “A lot of them can fight it off with their natural body, the antibodies and build that they have. There’s some people that are asymptomatic. “If that’s true, then yeah, we sequester them. And people say, ‘That’s crazy.’ No, it’s not crazy, because we need to continue to budget and run money through the state of Oklahoma.” Gundy apologized four days later, saying he understood his comments offended some people and that his first priority is the well-being of student-athletes. The Big 12 is allowing schools to bring football players to campus for voluntary workouts beginning June 15. Oklahoma State this week announced a phased approach for the return of its players. Under the plan, players who test positive are quarantined in separate housing and treated by medical staff. Contact tracing is done, and all that have been in contact will be instructed to quarantine and have symptoms monitored for a period determined by health and medical officials. After the determined quarantine time, if the traced contact group is not showing symptoms, the affected player will be retested for COVID-19 prior to resuming activities. Upon receiving a negative test, they will await specific instructions from the team physician and/or the athletic training staff regarding a return to activities. For most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms that clear up within weeks. But for others, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, the highly contagious virus can cause severe symptoms and be fatal. The vast majority of people recover. ___ More AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25"

Sparling ","Jun. 6, 2020",https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/2020/06/05/coronavirus-ohio-governor-let-theme-parks-casinos-reopen/3160436001/,"COLUMBUS – Ohio's amusement parks and casinos, including Kings Island, Coney Island and Jack Casino, can reopen as soon as June 19, Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine said Friday. The news comes after other theme parks and casinos across the country have begun to reopen amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. Universal Orlando became the first of Orlando's major theme park resorts to reopen, allowing annual pass-holders to return to its three parks Wednesday and Thursday. Walt Disney World plans to welcome back visitors to its parks in July, and Las Vegas casinos reopened Thursday. Kings Island and Cedar Point, both owned by Cedar Fair Entertainment Company, filed lawsuits against DeWine's administration on Thursday, saying orders were imposing criminal penalties on their business. But DeWine insists that the lawsuits – and a move from Ohio lawmakers to speed up opening dates for amusement parks and water parks – played no role in his decision. “They should have saved their money (spent) on lawyers,"" DeWine said. ""I told them a week ago that we would have an answer today, and that’s what we did."" Kings Island hasn't yet set a date to reopen.  ""The reopening of our parks is crucial to the economic viability of Erie County and Warren County,"" Cedar Fair Entertainment Company CEO Richard Zimmerman said in a statement. ""We look forward to getting back to business and hope that other states will follow Ohio’s lead in reopening parks around the country,"" Theme parks might look much different when they ultimately open. Temperature checks could be required of guests. More frequent cleaning and social distancing will be imposed where possible. Kings Island will announce more details closer to opening day. In addition to amusement parks and water parks, casinos and racinos can reopen as soon as June 19. But there will be restrictions: poker, coat check, valet services, concerts and banquets won't be available yet.  Las Vegas reopening starts tonight despite George Floyd protests. Here's what's on tap The maximum capacity will be limited to no more than 50% of fire code, most employees will wear face coverings and special hours will be set aside for at-risk populations, such as older adults. DeWine knows that some Ohioans, including several fellow Republicans, would rather he open all businesses in the state without any restrictions.  “To do that in the midst of this pandemic makes absolutely no sense,"" DeWine said. ""It would not be the right thing to do. Frankly, to do that would be an abandonment of the duty I have as your governor.” 'We felt super safe': Universal Orlando reopens; here's what it's like with coronavirus precautions Meanwhile, Ohio isn't testing as many residents as it planned to, and some lawmakers have proposed a way to limit contact tracing, which allows local health officials to track who has been infected.  Requiring written consent before conducting contact tracing would be ""a mistake,"" DeWine said. ""This is a solution without a problem."" As of Friday afternoon, 37,758 Ohioans had been infected with COVID-19 at one point, according to the Ohio Department of Health. Of those, 2,355 people had died and 6,385 had been hospitalized. In Ohio, 443,533 people had been tested for the respiratory virus, an increase of more than 8,900 reported from the previous day.  Contributing: Dawn Gilbertson, USA TODAY, Mike Schneider, Associated Press"
36,36,'We were founded as a sign of hope': Salzburg Festival will continue on a smaller scale,"Jun. 9, 2020",https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/2020/06/09/coronavirus-salzburg-festival-continue-smaller-scale/5325633002/,"The Salzburg Festival will be one of classical music’s few offerings in the summer of the coronavirus pandemic, staging a reduced 100th anniversary celebration with capacities limited to about 50%. Europe’s top festival announced Tuesday it will present 90 performances, down from 212 originally intended. Venues will be cut from 16 to seven and intermissions eliminated to reduce audience interaction. The only operas will be a Mozart’s “Cosi fan Tutte” in the Grosses Festspielhaus, limited to about 1,000 of its 2,300 seats, and Richard Strauss’ “Elektra” in the Felsenreitschule, which will hold roughly 700. Originally set to run from July 18 to Aug. 30, the festival will now start Aug. 1. Nearly every other major summer festival in Europe and the U.S. has been canceled. “It would have been much easier not to play, but we were founded as a sign of hope so we want to play,” festival president Helga Rabl-Stadler said in a telephone interview. The festival had sold 180,000 of 230,000 tickets to people in 80 nations but now is limiting seats to about 70,000. Only those who already bought tickets can still attend and there will be a limit of two per person. Names of purchasers will be printed on tickets and records kept to enable contact tracing. More:Cannes reveals lineup for film festival canceled by the coronavirus pandemic There are two active cases of COVID-19 in the Salzburg province, according to the Austrian government’s dashboard. “We do not know how many people will come, how many people will say, `Thank you. We love you but we don’t come here because it’s impossible, because of health reasons or I bake bread’ or something,″ Rabl-Stadler said. “So it’s like walking in a fog.” Every other seat will be left open. People in the audience must wear masks when entering, but will be allowed to remove them during the performance. Artists and backstage staff will be tested regularly. Backstage staff will be pared down and wear masks. Christof Loy’s staging of “Cosi fan Tutte” will have cuts. “It will be a super-modest set, super-modest costumes, a very-reduced rehearsal time,” artistic director Markus Hinterhäuser said. “A different `Cosi fan Tutte’ in corona times, if I might say. This is my little surprise.” There will be 14 performances of Hugo von Hofmannsthal’s “Jedermann (Everyman)” on the Domplatz in front of the cathedral, including one on Aug. 22 to mark the 100th anniversary of the day that play inaugurated the festival. Capacity in the square will be limited to 1,250 rather than 2,300. Rabl-Stadler said the festival will be short about 15 million euros ($17 million) in revenue, 8 million euros due to lost performances and the rest because of lower capacity. The festival usually generates 75% of revenue from tickets, sponsors and donations, Mozart’s “Don Giovanni” and “Die Zauberflöte (The Magic Flute),” Puccini’s “Tosca,” Donizetti’s “Don Pasquale” and Luigi Nono’s “Intolleranza” have been postponed to 2021 and Mussorgsky’s “Boris Godunov” to 2022. “We celebrate our 100th anniversary for two years,” she said.

37,37,"NASCAR bans Confederate flag from its races, venues","Jun. 11, 2020",https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nascar/2020/06/10/nascar-bans-confederate-flag-from-its-races-and-properties/111943956/,"For more than 70 years, the Confederate flag was a common and complicated sight at NASCAR races. Through the civil rights era right on through the season opener at Daytona in February, the flag dotted infield campsites and was waved in grandstands by fans young and old. As the nation — and at last, NASCAR — comes to grips with race relations in the wake of the death of George Floyd, it was time: The flag is no longer welcome in the stock car series. NASCAR banned the flag at its races and all its venues Wednesday, a dramatic step by a series steeped in Southern tradition and proud of its good ol' boy roots. It must now convince some of its most ardent fans that it is truly time to keep the flag at home, leave those T-shirts in the drawer, scrape off the bumper stickers and hit the track without a trace of the longtime symbol to many of racism and slavery. Policing the policy may prove challenging and NASCAR did not offer details. The issue was pushed to the forefront this week by Bubba Wallace, NASCAR’s lone black driver and an Alabama native who called for the banishment of the Confederate flag and said there was “no place” for it in the sport. The ban was announced before Wednesday night’s race at Martinsville Speedway in Virginia, where Wallace drove Richard Petty Motorsports’ No. 43 Chevrolet with a #BlackLivesMatter paint scheme. Wallace, wearing an American flag mask, clapped his hands when asked about the decision before the start of the race. “It’s been a stressful couple of weeks,” Wallace said on FS1. “This is no doubt the biggest race of my career tonight. I’m excited about tonight. There’s a lot of emotions on the race track.” He finished 11th and shifted straight to an interview on ESPN’s “SportsCenter.” Wallace wore a black “I Can’t Breathe” T-shirt but did not kneel during the national anthem. His Chevy had “Compassion, Love, Understanding” emblazoned on the hood. Bernice King, the youngest daughter of Martin Luther King Jr., tweeted ”#NASCAR, family” after the announcement, and scores of athletes followed the race on social media. The NAACP applauded NASCAR for taking the necessary step to “remove symbols of hate, racism, and discrimination from their events.” Floyd, a black man, died May 25 after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck while Floyd was handcuffed and saying that he couldn’t breathe. His death sparked protests that have roiled the nation for days, and Confederate monuments are being taken down across the South — the traditional fan base for NASCAR. “The presence of the Confederate flag at NASCAR events runs contrary to our commitment to providing a welcoming and inclusive environment for all fans, our competitors and our industry,"" NASCAR said. ""Bringing people together around a love for racing and the community that it creates is what makes our fans and sport special. The display of the Confederate flag will be prohibited from all NASCAR events and properties.” Enforcing the ban could require added security in the often rowdy, booze-fueled infield filled with fans who may be intent on thumbing their nose at NASCAR. The series declined additional comment. Fans have not been allowed back at races yet amid the coronavirus pandemic. It won't be long: NASCAR plans to welcome a small number of fans at a race Sunday near Miami and more later this month in Alabama. The decision had Confederate flag loyalists howling in protest and vowing to swear off the sport. Truck Series driver Ray Ciccarelli posted on Facebook he would quit the sport, writing: “I could care less about the Confederate Flag but there are ppl that do and it doesn’t make them a racist.” NASCAR helmet artist Jason Beam tweeted “ignorance wins again, NASCAR you realize the North had slaves too, lol not just the South, you want to remove the American Flag as well, idiots.” And a publicist for one NASCAR driver tweeted the decision was “a joke.” It almost didn't matter with an A-list show of support from actress Reese Witherspoon. Five years ago, the flag issue was front and center for NASCAR after nine black churchgoers were slain in Charleston, South Carolina. The man currently on death row for the murders, Dylann Roof, had embraced Confederate symbols before the attack, prompting a reappraisal of the role such symbols play in the South. The NASCAR chairman at the time, Brian France, said the series was ""working with the industry to see how far we can go to get that flag to be disassociated entirely from our events.” Tracks offered to exchange Confederate flags for American flags, but there were few takers and flags have continued to be seen at the events. NASCAR’s checkered history with race took another blow when driver Kyle Larson was fired in April after he uttered a racial slur during a live-streamed virtual race. Led by Wallace, some of NASCAR’s stars have forged ahead ready to create what they hope is a new legacy in the sport. Several drivers — including two-time Daytona 500 champion Denny Hamlin — said they supported Wallace in his quest to rid the sport of the flag. Ryan Blaney, one of Wallace's best friends, said after he finished second at Martinsville that he stood by Wallace. “I'm really proud of what he's doing, the effort he's putting in and wanting to kind of lead the charge,” Blaney said. “I stand behind him. A lot of guys stand behind him. Not only the drivers, but a lot of teams, as well. Crew members. The car he ran tonight was great. I loved that he was able to do that and come up with that idea.” The predominantly white field of drivers united over the weekend for a video promoting social change. A black NASCAR official, Kirk Price, took a knee before Sunday’s race near Atlanta in what may have been a first for the series. NASCAR President Steve Phelps addressed the drivers before that race and vowed to to do a better job of addressing racial injustice in the wake of Floyd’s death. ""Phelps and I have been in contact a lot just trying to figure out what steps are next,"" Wallace said. ""And that was a huge, pivotal moment for the sport. Lot of backlash, but it creates doors and allows the community to come together as one, and that’s what the real mission is here. So I’m excited about that.”"
38,38,"Is international travel allowed yet? See when Jamaica, St. Bart's, Austria plan to reopen bordersJayme Deerwester, Rasha Ali and Curtis Tate ",4:44 p.m. ET Jun. 13,https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/news/2020/05/20/international-travel-allowed-yet-when-destinations-reopening-coronavirus/5220301002/,"Americans with a bad case of wanderlust may have to wait until later this summer to vacation abroad – and while some countries, including Spain, have announced target dates to reopen, the pickings will be slim for a while. Parts of Mexico and the Caribbean have targeted dates in early to mid-June for reopening from coronavirus restrictions, and the Bahamas are planning to open July 1. But Europe will lag, opening first to other citizens of European Union and Schengen Area countries before welcoming international visitors at a later date. At least one EU member nation has announced a target window, however: Spain's prime minister announced that his country will reopen to foreign tourists sometime in July, though he did not specify a date. Iceland has said it will reopen its borders to foreign tourists on June 15, though there's a catch: Visitors will either have to agree to be tested for COVID-19 or self-quarantine for two weeks. It's worth noting that the U.S. State Department and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have not rescinded or downgraded their travel warnings. The State Department's global travel alert, first issued in March, is still in effect. For its part, the CDC still has its highest travel warning in effect for the United Kingdom, Ireland and most of Europe as well as China and Iran.  While this is by no means an exhaustive list, here's an update on some of the countries that are most popular with American travelers: When will the border open? Not until at least June 23, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Tuesday. He confirmed that his country's land border with the U.S. will remain closed for an additional 30 days. Trudeau and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security made the announcement two days before the order closing the border to nonessetial travel was set to expire.  There's a major loophole, though: The U.S. Embassy in Ottawa said the order does not apply to ""air, rail, or sea travel at this time, but does apply to commuter rail and ferry travel."" 'It was the right thing': Trudeau announces extension of US-Canada border closure “We're going to be very, very careful about reopening any international travel, including in the United States, before we feel that it is time,"" he said in April while announcing the previous extension. What can travelers expect once they're allowed in? Trudeau said Canada is “looking at stronger measures to make sure that we’re following up appropriately with people who come over"" in order to prevent a second wave of infections. When will the border open? On Tuesday, acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf announced that the land border with Mexico would remain closed through June 22. But like the U.S.-Canadian closure order, the Mexican version does not apply to air, rail or sea travel, except for commuter rail and ferry travel. Mexico said late last week that it would lift quarantine restrictions in less-affected regions starting Monday and begin reopening the rest of the country June 1. But on Saturday, the Ministry of Health recorded 2,500 new cases, the country's largest spike to date. When will it reopen its borders? Sometime between June 15 and July 1, according to a ""tentative"" estimate by the Aruba Tourism Authority. ""The aforementioned reopening target date is subject to change as we may consider additional precautionary measures as needed,"" it cautioned. When will it reopen its borders? July 1, the island nation announced May 29 in a Ministry of Tourism & Aviation release. The date is tentative and subject to change based on COVID-19 trends, namely, if there is a ""deterioration"" in the country's overall improvement. When will it reopen its borders?Jamaica's tourism board said the Caribbean island will welcome back international tourists beginning June 15.  What can tourists expect?Visitors will be checked for fever and coronavirus symptoms and those exhibiting either may be subject to additional screening, including a COVID-19 test. Any visitor who shows symptoms may be required to quarantine. The tourism board says its health protocols will be reviewed biweekly. When will it reopen its borders?Tourists are already welcome back in the U.S. territory. What can tourists expect? According to Puerto Rico's tourism board, all incoming commercial flights have been diverted to San Juan, where incoming guests must undergo a health screening upon arrival, including a brief interview and temperature check. Once admitted, all passengers are required to self-quarantine for 14 days regardless of whether they are symptomatic. In addition, an islandwide curfew remains in effect from 7 p.m. to 5 a.m. through May 25. The French territory will reopen to international tourists beginning June 22, according to its Facebook page. However, in order to enter the island, visitors will need to schedule a RT-PCR Covid-19 test and provide a negative result within 72 hours of arrival. Alternately, they can opt to be tested within 24 hours upon arrival and maintain strict quarantine for until their test comes back negative. Visitors who stay beyond seven days must undergo a second test. Anyone who tests positive will be moved to the quarantine center near the Stade de St Jean for monitoring. St. Lucia When will it reopen its borders? Flights from the U.S. will be the first allowed back into the Eastern Caribbean island beginning June 4, its government said in its reopening plan.  Visitors must present certified proof of a negative COVID-19 test taken within 48 hours of boarding their flight. Once there, they must wear face masks and practice social distancing. When will it reopen its borders? Hopefully, by June 1, according to a May 18 press conference by Gov. Albert Bryan Jr., who said he'd been working on a rollout plan with the departments of tourism and health and other groups. When will it reopen its borders? Austria plans to accept visitors from European countries except Sweden, Britain, Portugal and Spain on June 16.  According to the country's official tourism site, visitors entering Austria from other Schengen treaty countries must submit a medical certificate showing a negative COVID-19 test that was issued in the last four days. Tourists from outside the EU still may not fly into Austria for the time being. Foreign Minister Alexander Schallenberg also said Wednesday that the border with Italy to the south would be open without conditions, but warned Austrian citizens not to travel to Lombardy. The northern Italian region has been the epicenter of Italy’s epidemic, showing triple-digit growth in daily infections while much of the rest of the country counts a handful or fewer. Austria’s reluctance to open its shared border with Italy, which opened its borders on June 3, has been a sore spot between the neighbors, especially as the summer tourism season gets underway. When will it reopen its borders? Greece will accept visitors as of June 15 but only from 29 countries. The Greek Tourism Ministry said travelers from the permitted countries will be able to enter on direct flights to Athens and to the northern city of Thessaloniki. Visitors will be subject to sample coronavirus testing. “Our aim is to be able to welcome every tourist who has overcome their fear and has the ability to travel to our country,” Tourism Minister Harry Theoharis said on Antenna television. The 29 countries include: Albania, Australia, Austria, North Macedonia, Bulgaria, Germany, Denmark, Switzerland, Estonia, Japan, Israel, China, Croatia, Cyprus, Latvia, Lebanon, New Zealand, Lithuania, Malta, Montenegro, Norway, South Korea, Hungary, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Czech Republic and Finland. The list will be expanded on July 1 to include other countries, the ministry said.  When will it reopen its borders? Tourism minister Thordis Kolbrun Reykfjord Gylfadottir announced earlier this month that Iceland, which is part of the European Economic Area but not an EU member country, will begin easing restrictions on foreign tourists no later than June 15.  One condition of admission is that visitors must either be tested for coronavirus or spend two weeks in quarantine. However, citizens of countries that provide government records documenting a clean bill of health can opt to submit those instead, Reuters reported.  Regardless of which option visitors choose, they will be asked to download a contact-tracing app.  “Iceland’s strategy of large-scale testing, tracing and isolating have proven effective so far,” Gylfadottir told Reuters, explaining the country's relatively low rate of infection and death as well as its quick rebound. When will it reopen its borders? On Saturday, Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez announced that the country would be open to international tourism starting in July, Madrid-based newspaper El Pais and Reuters reported. “Spain needs tourism and tourism needs security,” Sanchez said. According to The Financial Times, tourism accounts for 12% of Spain's gross domestic product. It welcomes 80 millions tourists each year. When will it reopen its borders? Italy, which is one of the European countries hit hardest by the coronavirus, will relax its border restrictions on June 3. At that time, Italians can travel between regions or to other European Union countries and the United Kingdom, and citizens of those countries can travel to Italy. When will it reopen its borders? French citizens can travel within a 100-kilometer (62 mile) radius of where they live, but for now, its borders remain closed. When will it reopen its borders? Germany continues to restrict entry to non-European Union citizens through at least June 15. When will the rest of Europe reopen its borders? Not until after June 15 and probably later than that for non-EU citizens. Earlier this month, the European Union proposed that Schengen Area members and associated countries keep their borders closed to non-EU nationals until June 15 so they could continue to coordinate the continent's response to the pandemic. Nearly all of the 30 countries involved have adopted the proposal. In mid-April, the European Union Commission presented a phased roadmap that will first restore free movement between member countries and then relax external border restrictions during the second stage. Good news for British citizens yearning to travel: The EU also said that citizens of the United Kingdom will continue to be treated as EU citizens until the end of the transition period and would be able to travel once internal borders are relaxed. Beginning June 8, travelers can enter the UK, but they must provide contact information and self-isolate for 14 days, or face fines. When will the border open? Not for at least three more months, according to an April 23 statement by the country's chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy. And the only mention of international travel in Prime Minister Scott Morrison's reopening plan comes in the final stage, when the country will consider allowing in other Pacific islanders and international students. When will the border open? The country where the pandemic began in December briefly reopened its borders to non-citizens before closing them again in late March due to an influx of new cases. It has not said when it plans to relax those restrictions. When will the border open? In a May 31 statement posted to its Ministry of Tourism website, the Maldives announced it would open its borders to tourists in July, though no specific date was specified. ""Tourists will be welcomed,"" Ali Razzan, senior executive director of the Ministry wrote in the statement. ""And, no additional fees will be charged from any tourist visiting the Maldives.""

MSC is suspending operations through July 31, according to a company press release, one week after the CDC's no-sail order is set to expire.  MSC Cruises USA guests will receive a 125% future cruise credit of their original fare paid by June 19 for use on a sailing by Dec. 31, 2021. This applies to guests who were set to sail July 11 to July 31 but had their cruises canceled. For guests with bookings between Aug. 1 through Oct. 31, they are now eligible for the company's cruise assurance program, which lets passengers cancel trips up to 48 hours in advance of departure and reschedule with a 100% future cruise credit (also for use on a sailing by Dec. 31, 2021). The program lets passengers change bookings whether they went through the company directly or through a travel adviser. The company has canceled several sailings for next year: Passengers affected by the summer 2021 itinerary changes can redirect funds to any other ship and receive a $50 shipboard credit per person. Passengers need to make a new booking within the next 60 days, or they can submit a refund request to the company or their travel adviser. MSC will debut two new ships currently under construction, the MSC Virtuosa and MSC Seashore, bringing the company's fleet to 19 ships. ""Our ships will return to service only when the time is right, in phases and by region, and following guidance from the relevant national and international health and other regulatory authorities and the support of a new operating protocol especially focused on health and safety, which we will announce soon,"" Gianni Onorato, CEO of MSC Cruises, said in a statement. ""This way, gradually, all of our ships will return to sea between then and the beginning of our summer 2021 season."" The company will also add new deployments next year: British cruise line P&O Cruises, a Carnival subsidiary, is canceling all its sailings until Oct. 15 because of the coronavirus pandemic – after a move by Canada to ban cruises and ferries carrying more than 100 people with overnight capacity in its waters through Oct. 31.  While Canada's ban on cruises has been pushed into the fall, the CDC's no-sail order is set to lift after July 24, and major cruise companies, including Norwegian, Royal Caribbean, Carnival and Disney, have extended their sailing suspensions just past that date. Royal Caribbean also announced it would cancel sailings to Alaska, Canada and New England through October. Princess Cruises also is extending its cancellation of some sailings through October.

(AP) — Seven Arkansas State athletes tested positive for COVID-19 and are self-isolating for 14 days, Chancellor Kelly Damphousse said Thursday. The seven athletes are from three sports, and all were asymptomatic. They learned the results Wednesday night. Damphousse said contact tracing has begun, and anyone who has been exposed to any of the seven athletes will be required to quarantine for 14 days. “This is a day that we knew would come, not just at A-State, but for colleges and universities across America,” Damphousse said. An Arkansas State spokesman said he didn’t know how many athletes have been tested since they began returning to campus for voluntary workouts. Oklahoma State and Marshall have announced they’ve each had three athletes test positive. Mississippi also has had an athlete and staff member test positive. A student worker in the Iowa State athletic department also has COVID-19. Alabama also reportedly had multiple positive tests. At least five Crimson Tide football players have tested positive for the coronavirus, according to 247Sports, which cited multiple unnamed sources. Citing privacy laws, the university declined to comment on the reported results, saying it “cannot share information specific to the health of our student-athletes.” “The health and safety of our student-athletes is a top priority,” the university said in a statement. “Resources and protocols are in place to ensure they receive the best medical care when returning to campus.” Players returned to Tuscaloosa this week and are set to start voluntary workouts on Monday. For most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms that clear up within weeks.

Alabama with five and Arkansas State with seven are the latest revealed Thursday, joining Oklahoma State, Iowa State, Marshall and Mississippi as known schools with positive tests in recent days.  “This is a day that we knew would come, not just at A-State, but for colleges and universities across America,” Arkansas State Chancellor Kelly Damphousse said. The seven athletes there are from three sports, and all were asymptomatic. They learned of the positive results Wednesday night and will self-isolate for 14 days. Damphousse said contact tracing has begun, and anyone who has been exposed to any of the seven athletes will be required to quarantine for 14 days. An Arkansas State spokesman said he didn’t know how many athletes have been tested since they began returning to campus for voluntary workouts.  The five at Alabama are football players, according to BamaInsider of the Rivals Network. Players have been returning to campus to prepare for voluntary workouts starting Monday. Alabama would not confirm the positive tests but issued a statement to The Tuscaloosa News through Ryan Bradley, interim vice president for Strategic Communications: “The health and safety of our student-athletes is a top priority. Resources and protocols are in place to ensure they receive the best medical care when returning to campus. Due to privacy laws we cannot share information specific to the health of our student-athletes.”  Players have been working out with each other at the band’s practice field. Oklahoma State and Marshall have announced they’ve each had three athletes test positive. Mississippi also has had an athlete and staff member test positive. Four athletes from two sports at Iowa State are in quarantine and awaiting COVID-19 test results after experiencing symptoms and being in close contact with individuals outside of the athletic department who have been infected by the virus, the school announced Wednesday.

42,42,Fact check: Children will not be put in foster homes by the government under new legislationMcKenzie Sadeghi and Chelsey Cox ,"May 29, 2020",https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2020/05/29/fact-check-house-coronavirus-bill-wouldnt-put-kids-foster-care/5191909002/,"Shortly after Congress introduced another bill in an effort to combat COVID-19, social media claims surfaced that children would be put in foster care if someone in the household tested positive for COVID-19 and didn't have enough space to quarantine. “Am I ok with social services coming into my house and removing my child to put them in a foster home if I don’t have ample space to ‘quarantine’ if I was to get sick?” one Instagram post reads, referencing H.R. 6666 COVID-19 Testing, Reaching, And Contacting Everyone (TRACE) Act. The user who posted that claim did not respond to USA TODAY's request for comment.  Other posts offer similar fears.  The TRACE Act was introduced May 1 by Rep. Bobby Rush, D-Ill. The bill aims to fund contact tracing to battle coronavirus outbreaks and the provision of mobile units for virus testing. Fact check: Bill Gates did not craft contact tracing bill The TRACE Act would provide $100 billion in grants for mobile testing units run by health centers, school-based health clinics, nonprofits, academic medical centers and any other entity that is deemed eligible by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The grants would be allocated to the organizations to “hire, train, compensate, and pay the expenses of individuals” and to “purchase personal protective equipment and other supplies.” More:Apple and Google release coronavirus contact tracing technology for public health mobile apps The bill also focuses on contact tracing with door-to-door outreach, with special preference toward those operating in hot spots and medically underserved communities.The aim of contact tracing is to identify those who might have been in contact with a coronavirus-positive person to limit the spread of the virus. The TRACE Act gives authorization to the secretary of Health and Human Services, acting through the CDC director, to “trace and monitor the contacts of infected individuals, and to support the quarantine of such contacts.” The CDC has said contact tracing is a key strategy for preventing COVID-19 from spreading and that “immediate action is needed.” Nothing in the bill sponsored by Rush says the government will be given authority to enter homes and remove children if there is not enough space for an infected family member to quarantine. Rush turned to social media and his website to address the false claims about the bill that have been widely spread a little over a week after the bill was introduced. A press release from Rush’s office debunks the claim that the bill allows the government to send social workers to homes and remove children if parents or guardians were to test positive for the virus. “I’ve seen these alarming posts as well, but I can assure you that they are completely false,” Rush wrote. “This bill does not authorize anyone to enter your home, for whatever reason, without your permission, nor does it allow the government to remove anyone from your home because of the coronavirus.” The Chicago congressman noted the main purpose of the bill is to provide access to testing and outreach for underserved communities who want to get tested. “This bill is about helping our country safely reopen the economy so we can get back to normal!” he wrote. In a tweet, Rush said, “Question: How can we ensure our liberties will be preserved? Answer: I have spent my entire life fighting for the liberty of my community & others. There is nothing in this bill that will threaten anyone’s individual liberties. Again, this bill is about increasing testing.” In anothertweet Rush said, ""The COVID-19 TRACE Act would not authorize removing #coronavirus patients from their homes or require testing. This bill is about providing testing and outreach to communities that are being hit the hardest by this deadly disease."" Fact check:Under TRACE Act, cellphones will not be updated with ‘COVID-19 traceability' We rate the claim that the bill would allow the government to send social services into homes to put children in foster care if someone in the household tested positive for COVID-19 as FALSE because it is not supported by our research. The bill does not authorize the government to enter homes and remove family members to be quarantined or place children in foster care. Rep. Bobby Rush has debunked the claim in a press release and on social media. Further, nothing in the bill states children can be removed from homes under the TRACE Act.  Thank you for supporting our journalism. You can subscribe to our print edition, ad-free app or electronic newspaper replica here.

43,43,WHO official walks back comments on asymptomatic transmission being 'very rare'Adrianna Rodriguez ,"Jun. 10, 2020",https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2020/06/09/coronavirus-who-walks-back-comments-asymptomatic-spread/5325282002/,"An official leading the World Health Organization’s COVID-19 response clarified comments made at a media briefing Monday that suggested coronavirus transmission by asymptomatic individuals is ""very rare.""  Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove, WHO’s technical lead, said in a video posted on the organization’s Twitter feed that she was referring to a small subset of studies and unpublished information from member states when making the comments. “I wasn’t stating a policy of WHO or anything like that, I was just trying to articulate what we know,” she said. “And in that I used the phrase ‘very rare,’ and I think that’s a misunderstanding to state that asymptomatic transmission globally is very rare.” In contact tracing efforts from other countries, secondary transmission from asymptomatic individuals was rarely found, Kerkhove said, but the subject is still “a major unknown.” She said models that attempt to estimate asymptomatic transmission vary greatly – some predict spread by people without symptoms may make up to 40% of transmissions. Monday’s comments fueled tweets by anti-lockdown activists questioning the country’s decision to shutter businesses in the name of public health, leading to record unemployment and job loss. ""We shut ournation down, nearly destroyed the economy, and have people wearing masks for no reasons other than govt. control,"" tweeted Newsmax TV host John Cardillo.  Some public health experts noted Kerkhove’s failure to support her claim with published studies, while others rushed to her defense. “It makes sense,” Dr. Faheem Younus, chief of infectious diseases at the University of Maryland Upper Chesapeake Health, said on Twitter. “Each cough may emit ~3000 and sneeze ~40,000 droplets from a symptomatic patient. The risk is much less with asymptomatic.” Opinion:I treat COVID patients and work with WHO. Trump risks our health by cutting ties 'More masks than jellyfish':Environmental groups worry about coronavirus waste in oceans Kerkhove reiterated some of her points in Tuesday’s clarification video, including that some pre-symptomatic cases may have been misidentified as asymptomatic. Other individuals, she said, may have been misidentified as asymptomatic because they didn’t present common COVID-19 symptoms such as fever, cough and shortness of breath, instead exhibitingmuch milder symptoms. Kerkhove said much research is being done to determine when someone has COVID-19 and is truly asymptomatic and what proportion of that population actually transmits the disease. “That’s a big open question, and that remains an open question,” she said. Many experts on Twitter criticized Kerkhove for not differentiating between asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic cases as multiple studies suggest people who don’t exhibit any symptoms are able to transmit the disease. A report published in the New England Journal of Medicine in late May found more than half of residents with positive coronavirus test results at a nursing home in Washington were pre-symptomatic at the time of testing and most likely contributed to transmission. A small study published in the peer-reviewed journal Nature in April found COVID-19 patients may be most contagious two to three days before symptoms appear. Researchers estimated 44% of transmissions in their study occurred during the index patient’s pre-symptomatic stage. Additionally, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates in planning scenarios that 40% of virus transmissions occur prior to symptom onset. ""That's why it's important to avoid people as much as possible, to wash your hands, to wear masks,"" Tara Smith, a professor of epidemiology at Kent State University. ""To prevent you from spreading the virus.""  Contributing: N'dea Yancey-Bragg, USA TODAY.

44,44,CDC creates new color-coded system to designate ships with potential coronavirus exposureDavid Oliver ,"Jun. 3, 2020",https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/cruises/2020/06/03/coronavirus-cdc-creates-new-color-coded-system-mark-covid-19-ships/3133193001/,"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention updated its COVID-19 guidance regarding cruise ships this week amid the U.S. ongoing no-sail order, set to expire July 24. This week's update included a new color-coded system, plus instructions about the use of commercial transportation for crew disembarkation, according to CDC spokesman Scott Pauley. Cruise ships are assigned a ""green,"" ""yellow"" or ""red"" designation, related to the presence of COVID-19 on the ship. Green ships have had no confirmed COVID-19 cases or similar illnesses for 28 days; yellow ships are awaiting test results; and red ships have had confirmed or similar illnesses in the ast 28 days. Crew transfers and repatriation via commercial means are now allowed on green ships but not on yellow or red ones. Here's what each designation means in detail: Green (currently unaffected by COVID-19, per the cruise line): Yellow Red 'Like prisoners':Crews are still marooned aboard cruise ships mired in red tape Each designation also means there are certain requirements and recommendations for asymptomatic crew members aboard. For example: Crew members on green ships are recommended to stay in single-occupancy cabins with private bathrooms, while that is required on yellow and red ships. The closure of all crew bars, gyms or other group settings is not required on green ships, but it is the case on yellow and red ships. Handshaking is discouraged on all ships. If a confirmed green ship wishes to use commercial transportation to disembark crew, it has to submit a plan to the CDC. The CDC will inform the ship if it has made ""green"" clearance and will post a list of these ships on its website. Commercial travel won't be allowed if the ship status changes to yellow or red. Trade group Cruise Lines International Association said ""the cruise industry is committed to working with the CDC to understand the new requirements and seek clarity regarding the use of commercial transportation for the repatriation of healthy crew,"" according to a statement provided by spokesperson Bari Golin-Blaugrund. ""Since the voluntary suspension of cruise passenger operations in mid-March, CLIA ocean-going cruise line members have been working around the clock to arrange for the repatriation of thousands of crewmembers from at least 100 countries, each with its own set of travel restrictions. ... The International Health Regulations of the World Health Organization require all governments to treat persons 'with respect for their dignity, human rights and fundamental freedoms and minimize any discomfort or distress' when implementing health measures. These principles remain a critical component of the cruise lines’ efforts to arrange for the safe return of crewmembers to their homes and families."" Royal Caribbean, for its part, is reviewing the new guidance. ""We are studying the CDC’s latest update. We will continue to work with CDC and other authorities toward our shared goal of getting our crew safely home,"" Royal Caribbean spokesperson Jonathon Fishman told USA TODAY. Cruise ship operators say they are  eager to get crews home.  The Cruise Line International Association indicated its members are doing their best to abide by CDC rules and to repatriate crews. Executives at individual companies, however, are far more direct. ""We are doing everything we possibly can for our crew, and we are frustrated as they are about the difficulty in getting them home,"" Frank Del Rio, CEO of Norwegian Cruise Line, told USA TODAY. ""Money is literally no object. We are willing to charter flights home, wherever home may be."" The problem, he said, is ""we are dealing with a regulatory landscape that seems to change daily and forces us to adjust our plans just as frequently."" Major cruise companies, including Norwegian, Royal Caribbean, Carnival and Disney, have extended their sailing suspensions just past the July 24 expiration date. British cruise line P&O Cruises, a Carnival subsidiary, is canceling all its sailings until Oct. 15 because of the coronavirus pandemic – after a move by Canada to ban cruises and ferries carrying more than 100 people with overnight capacity in its waters through Oct. 31.  Royal Caribbean also announced it would cancel sailings to Alaska, Canada and New England through October. ""As a result of the Government of Canada’s decision to extend its restriction on cruise ships carrying more than 100 guests until Oct. 31, Royal Caribbean 2020 sailings to Canada, New England and Alaska must be canceled,"" Fishman confirmed to USA TODAY. ""We are working with public health agencies and governments to ensure a safe return to service, and look forward to setting sail from and to these destinations next year,"" he added.

45,45,"Gun shops flouted state closure orders in April as industry notched another big monthChampe Barton and Daniel Nass, The Trace, and Kevin Johnson ","May 15, 2020",https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/investigations/2020/05/14/gun-shops-flouted-state-coronavirus-closures-fueling-sales-boom/3115968001/,"This story was co-published with The Trace, a nonprofit newsroom covering guns in America. Gun stores in several states have defied orders to close their doors as the coronavirus pandemic drives historic demand for firearms, according to background check data maintained by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and interviews with shop owners.  Governors of five states – Massachusetts, Michigan, New Mexico, New York, and Washington – ordered gun dealers to close in April under statewide stay-at-home directives. FBI data from April shows that dealers in those states still initiated tens of thousands of gun background checks. In Washington state alone, where gun shops were shuttered by a March 25 stay-at-home order, 42,000 checks were initiated in April.  Some businesses, such as Walmart and hardware stores, sell guns in addition to food and other household items deemed essential during the pandemic, such as Walmart and hardware stores. At least two of the five states – Michigan and New York – have allowed these stores to continue selling firearms. However, big-box stores typically account for only a fraction of all gun sales. And phone calls to more than 50 dedicated gun dealers confirmed that many remained open in defiance of state orders to close. During April, the National Instant Criminal Background Check System processed 2.9 million checks, making it the fourth highest month on record, dating back to 1998. The Trace compared the number of background checks for handguns, long guns, and transactions involving both types of gun with the same figures for 2019. In some of the states where stores were ordered closed, dealers conducted more checks in April than during the same month in 2019. In Washington state, for instance, checks increased 45% over April 2019; in New Mexico, they increased 15%.  Checks increased by 112% in Michigan, where at least part of the surge may be attributed to a March 3 ruling by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, according to a spokesperson for the Michigan State Police. That ruling said that firearms dealers cannot accept a Michigan-issued concealed carry permit in lieu of conducting a background check, adding gun transfers to permit holders – previously not counted – to the FBI data. Anthony Coulson, a former Drug Enforcement Administration agent who is an expert on the background check system, said the increased gun sales rendered the stay-at-home orders “meaningless.”  “What’s the motivation for implementing a nonessential order if it’s not going to be enforced and has no impact?” Coulson asked. The two states that didn’t register any year-over-year increase in firearm background checks were New York and Massachusetts. In New York, the number of checks hovered just below normal levels. In Massachusetts, background checks saw a significant year-over-year decrease, falling 66%.  Store owners offered a litany of reasons they are violating the orders. Some considered them a breach of their Second Amendment rights. Some felt emboldened by a March 28 revision to Department of Homeland Security guidance that deemed the gun industry an essential business during the pandemic. The DHS guidance, which is nonbinding, was heavily pushed by the National Shooting Sports Foundation, the industry trade group. Other store owners said they felt that they could operate safely if they took reasonable precautions. Still others said they considered their businesses exempt from statewide restrictions. “I would say that I’m supposed to be closed,” said Dennis Brown, who owns Shoreline Tactical, a gun shop in Shoreline, Washington. But with so many stores closed, “people can’t get their guns. So I’ve elected to stay open on an appointment-only basis.” Defiant stores more often than not went unpunished, The Trace found, despite proclamations from several governors that states would mete out harsh penalties to noncompliant businesses of all types.  The April background check numbers continue a trend first spotted by The Trace in early March, when gun store owners along the West Coast saw a surge in Asian American customers fearful of xenophobic backlash to the virus. By the end of the month, fears of social unrest spread to the general public, driving a historic sales bump. The FBI processed a record number of checks in March, outstripping the prior high by 12%. As USA TODAY has reported, the increase has overwhelmed the federal background check system, prompting the FBI to warn gun retailers that screenings could take up to a month to complete. An FBI spokesperson said  the system “remains fully operational and will continue to process requests.” Surge in gun sales:FBI background check system overwhelmed while dealers are urged to wait on sales In each of the five states where gun stores were deemed nonessential, The Trace contacted retailers to inquire whether they were open. In Michigan, 15 of 20 stores said that they were open to walk-in customers. The remaining five did not answer their phones. In Washington, all 10 dealers contacted were also selling guns, but some emphasized that they required customers to schedule appointments to ensure social distancing.  In New Mexico, 9 out of 10 dealers contacted were open throughout April; in New York, four out of 10 stores contacted said the same. The remaining stores in both states did not answer calls. Only in Massachusetts did most stores appear to be closed. Of 20 gun retailers contacted in the state, only one – in Montague – reported being open. Three others declined to answer questions; the rest did not answer calls.  Shawn Brancheau, who runs Guns Galore in Fenton, Michigan, said that he considers his store an essential business even though Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has said the opposite. “Home defense needs to be a consideration of the governor at a time like this,” he said, adding that he felt justified staying open because of the Department of Homeland Security’s March guidance. He questioned the constitutionality of any order that would require gun stores to close and said local police had already been in his store to shop and took no action. “Either there is no Second Amendment or you have the right to bear arms,” Brancheau said.  Steve Hayes, an owner of Bob’s Gun and Tackle Shop Inc. in Hastings, Michigan, said he understood that state orders superseded the federal guidance, but said Michigan’s order was too ambiguous. A call to the attorney’s general office, he says, provided little clarity. “Local authorities are giving different answers,” he said. “It’s been very confusing for a lot of store owners, and probably for customers, too, when they see one store shut and one store open.” Hayes said he received a written exemption from his local police department allowing him to stay open but declined to provide a copy of the document. Calls to the Barry County Sheriff’s Department, which has jurisdiction over Hayes’ store, were not returned. Other store owners said their livelihoods depend upon keeping their doors open. Chris Burnett, who operates Kokopelli Pawn and Gun in Aztec, New Mexico, opened his shop just before the coronavirus reached the U.S. He says the New Mexico State Police have visited three times in the past month, instructing him to close his store. On the third visit, troopers fined him $100 and warned him that continued noncompliance could result in a six-month jail sentence.  Still, he stayed open. “I just threw everything into my business,” he said. “I have two little girls at home to feed.” Some retailers said that even in states where the closure orders were unambiguous, they had found wiggle room to continue operating. Ryan Blake, who runs High Plains Gun Shop six hours east of Burnett’s store, in Clovis, New Mexico, said his store had been approved to stay open by local authorities.  “We’re essentially a department of an essential business since we’re located in a hardware store,” he said. “So we’ve fallen under a gray area.”  Likewise, Paul Smith, who runs S&S Gun Sales in Auburn, New York, said he found a loophole in Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s order.  “We were not originally on the list of essential businesses, but being a single proprietor gun store owner, I realized I could be open when I choose to,” he said. New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham’s office, which has the authority to issue exemptions to New Mexico’s stay-at-home order, did not respond to requests for comment. In New York, a spokesperson for the Empire State Development Corporation, which determines which businesses are considered essential under Cuomo’s order, said that gun stores, like all nonessential retail, were permitted to have one person in the shop to fulfill online orders.  Many states have struck a hard tack on businesses violating stay-at-home orders, threatening fines and criminal charges for those who ignore initial warnings. But noncompliant firearm retailers appear to have largely avoided such penalties outside of New Mexico. A spokesperson for the New Mexico State Police said that six gun dealers there were issued cease and desist letters in April.  Enforcing the shutdown: Law enforcement grapples with policing stay-at-home orders, social distancing, quarantines In Michigan, for example, a spokesperson for the state’s attorney general’s office told the Detroit Free Press that nonessential businesses could face forced closures and up to 90 days in jail for refusing to comply with the governor’s order. The Michigan State Police recently cited an Owosso barber shop for noncompliance, asking it to close or face harsher penalties.  But several of the Michigan gun retailers interviewed for this story said that local authorities were aware of their operations and had taken no action. When provided background check data suggesting noncompliance among gun stores in the state, a spokesperson for the Michigan attorney general’s office said that enforcement was being handled at the local level. He added, “There has been nothing in Gov. Whitmer’s executive orders that has specifically referenced firearm retailers.” In Washington, Gov. Jay Inslee outlined a three-tier penalty system for offending businesses: one violation earned a warning; another led to citations and possible business license revocation; one more could result in criminal charges.  But media reports suggest that few if any Washington state businesses have been hit with severe penalties. The Seattle Times and Komo News have reported on lax enforcement efforts for noncompliant businesses like gyms and construction sites.  According to records obtained from the Washington Military Department, which receives complaints about compliance in the state, several gun stores also have continued to operate after allegations of noncompliance. One, Lynnwood Guns and Ammunition, was the subject of more than 20 complaints in the state’s database, all of which alleged large crowds and a lack of enforcement of social distancing requirements. One complainant alleged that they had confronted the store’s proprietor and shown her that gun stores are not essential per the governor’s order. “She asked me to leave,” the complaint reads. A representative from Lynnwood Guns and Ammunition declined to comment.  Overall, the Washington Military Department received more than 200 complaints about noncompliant gun stores since the state’s stay-at-home order took effect on March 25 – and more than 100 requests from retailers for exemptions from the order. It’s unclear from the records whether any of those exemptions were granted. In Massachusetts, both the state police and the attorney’s general office directed questions about compliance to the governor’s office, which did not respond to multiple requests for comment about the state’s enforcement efforts. The Massachusetts Department of Health said enforcement was handled by municipalities; spokespeople for police departments in Worcester and Framingham reported that gun stores in those cities were all compliant with the order. The  ATF, the nation’s gun enforcement agency, said that violations of state and local laws could put dealers’ federal licenses at risk. Applicants must affirm that they are in compliance with local and state laws before licenses are conferred and every three years when licenses are renewed. License status for dealers charged with local offenses, the ATF said, likely would be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. The National Rifle Association referred questions to the National Shooting Sports Foundation. There, general counsel Larry Keane said it was “not surprising” that gun sales did not suffer in states where firearms dealers were restricted or prohibited from operating during the health emergency.  Keane said that local enforcement of the state executive orders has not been consistent across the states. “In some areas, local sheriffs are not going to force gun shops to close because that’s where law enforcement buys equipment to do the job,” he said. “We are aware that local law enforcement have been advising dealers in some cases not to close because that’s where they are buying ammunition and firearms.”  Keane said the foundation has made no effort to advise dealers on actual operations. Rather, he said the group has provided the industry with a running list of orders approved by the state, including the essential business operations recognized in those jurisdictions. “We are not telling people to open; we are not telling people to close,” Keane said. “We’re just providing access to good information.” Christian Heyne, the vice president of policy for the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence, called gun stores' disobedience deeply concerning. The United States relies on gun stores, as federally licensed businesses, to follow state and federal guidelines to ensure the safety of communities across the country, he said, “so it is incredibly alarming to think that there are a number of gun dealers that are essentially going rogue."" Meanwhile, the NRA has vigorously condemned states that ordered gun retailers to shutter and filed lawsuits against governors in New Mexico and New York. Massachusetts and Michigan also face lawsuits over their orders. As states phase in their reopening plans, the situation for gun sales is rapidly changing. On May 1, New Mexico’s governor said gun stores could reopen on an appointment-only basis. On May 7, a federal judge in Massachusetts ruled that the state’s shutdown of gun stores was unconstitutional. Stores there officially reopened for business on May 9."

The county, with 2,100 cases, now has the second-highest number of virus cases in the state, second only to Mobile. Dr. Don Williamson, president of the Alabama Hospital Association, said the trends in central Alabama are alarming. “It’s community transmission,” Williamson said. He said there is not a single location, like a nursing home, behind the rise in Montgomery cases. The Hospital Association said in a news release that the rate of new cases in Montgomery is outpacing other urban areas, with the county reporting more than 800 new cases in the last two weeks, about twice what was seen in Jefferson and Mobile counties. Williamson said the influx of virus cases has helped fill intensive care units similar to what happens in flu season, although hospitals have rooms and ventilators for critically ill patients. But he said they need the community’s help to avoid being overwhelmed. “You don’t need to go out and do things just because you can. Minimizing exposure, wearing a mask, washing hands and social distancing are critically important,” Williamson said.

The mining company said the drilling program is its largerst in 12 years, but operations were suspended in March as the state issued health restrictions on travel and mandated quarantines of out-of-state workers, Alaska’s Energy Desk reported Monday. Donlin announced summer plans to rotate 60 people in two crews, working three weeks on and then three weeks off. The company said it will require employees to take coronavirus screening tests before arriving at the mine and again when they leave. In addition to screening, the company expects to use charter flights to transport workers to and from the mine and require workers to maintain 6 feet of distance in eating areas and living quarters. The company hopes to build one of the largest gold mines in the world, and recently began drilling for samples to expand the mine’s operating life. After the completing construction of the mine, company officials believe the production could last 27 years or longer depending on the size of the deposit. Donlin Gold spokesperson Kristina Woolston said the company continues to hire employees. As part of its lease agreement with two Alaska Native Regional Corporations that own the land and mineral rights, Donlin must prioritize shareholder hires. Donlin has not provided precise figures of the number of people arriving from outside the region to work at its mining camps. Phoenix: The number of Maricopa County jail inmates who have tested positive for the new coronavirus has increased sharply over the last five days, leading officials to consider mass testing at county correctional facilities. Officials on Monday night reported that 203 of the county’s approximately 4,500 inmates have tested positive, compared to 30 cases as of Thursday. Nineteen Maricopa County detention officers also have tested positive. The number of cases in Maricopa County’s jails is approaching the total in state prisons, where 237 of Arizona’s 40,000 prisoners have tested positive. The increase in Maricopa County jails came as more inmates were tested and the county conducts contact tracing inside detention facilities. Some inmates who previously tested negative have since been confirmed to have contracted the virus. Inmates who tested positive are isolated and being treated. Fields Moseley, a spokesman for the county agency that specializes in providing health care to inmates, said mass testing is one of several options being considered by officials as they manage the risks of COVID-19 behind bars. Moseley said mass testing would be undertaken only if health officials conclude it’s needed. Last week, the American Civil Liberties Union called for all inmates in Maricopa County jails to be tested, saying the virus can spread quickly once an outbreak occurs in a detention facility. Moseley said the county’s consideration of large-scale testing isn’t a response to the ACLU. Little Rock: Gov. Asa Hutchinson said Tuesday he will announce this week whether the state can further ease coronavirus restrictions even as the number of cases in the state passed 10,000. Hutchinson said he planned to announce Wednesday whether and when the state can enter “Phase 2” of reopening. Arkansas has allowed businesses that closed because of the pandemic to reopen in recent weeks but with limits on capacity and other safety rules. The Republican governor previewed the announcement as he faced pushback from a GOP lawmaker in northeast Arkansas who said businesses in his district are preparing to defy the state and ease restrictions on their own starting Friday. Rep. Dan Sullivan, who called the state’s current restriction’s “excessive” in a letter to Hutchinson dated Monday, declined to name the businesses. Sullivan said he has met with about 12 to 15 restaurants in his district about the issue. “The restaurants I met with and many constituents would like for us to move forward and more freedom,” Sullivan said. Hutchinson said he hadn’t spoken with Sullivan, but said businesses that defy the state’s restrictions could jeopardize their licenses. “I get letters from both sides,” Hutchinson said. “I get letters saying you’re going too fast, slow down, don’t open things up. I get letters that say you’re going too slow, you’ve got to open it up quicker.” Yosemite National Park: The park will reopen with restrictions on Thursday after being closed for more than 21/2 months because of the coronavirus outbreak, officials announced Monday. The number of visitors admitted starting Thursday will be restricted to about half of those that typically visit this time of year, the National Park Service said. In addition, some park facilities including campgrounds and visitor centers, will remain closed or have limited access to help prevent the spread of the virus. “It’s going to be a different kind of summer, and we will continue to work hand in hand with our gateway communities to protect community health and restore access to Yosemite National Park,” Acting Superintendent Cicely Muldoon said in a statement. Yosemite had about 4.6 million visitors in 2019. The park known for gushing waterfalls, granite peaks and giant sequoias was shut down March 20. Fort Collins:The Poudre School District said it hopes to have students in classrooms when the 2020-21 school year starts in August. The district’s governing board on Tuesday was presented with a plan for learning in the fall, with four possible scenarios outlined for how to continue education under potential public health restrictions meant to stem the spread of the new coronavirus. The four scenarios are: Schools are closed. Instruction is carried out remotely. This is how the dsitrict ended the 2019-20 year after closing in March because of the spread of COVID-19; limited in-person learning, with gatherings of 10 people or less. Most learning would be remote, but there could be limited in-person interaction in small groups; students are broken into “A” and “B” groups with A in classrooms Monday and Wednesday and B in classrooms Tuesday and Thursday. Friday would be a day for at-home learning and teacher collaboration; all students in school all day. The district might limit classrooms to 20 to 25 people and would likely require health safety measures such as temperature checks, contact tracing and the use of personal protective equipment. “It’s our desire to have our students in school every single day, all day, all of our students,” Assistant Superintendent of Elementary Schools Todd Lambert said. “I expect us to likely open the year in a likely hybrid model.” The district is expected to be decided at the start of August on which scenario to use based on existing public health guidelines from county and state health departments. Hartford: The University of Connecticut tentatively set Aug. 31 as the first day of classes, but President Thomas Katsouleas cautioned students and staff that it won’t be business as usual because of the coronavirus pandemic. “Our draft plans call for an academic semester and campus experience that will be unlike any we have seen previously,” Katsouleas wrote in a letter Wednesday to members of the UConn community. “Successfully coming back and maintaining safety will require the cooperation and flexibility of our entire community during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.” Under the plan, which will be submitted to the Board of Trustees for consideration and then to state officials in the coming weeks, there will be a mix of online and face-to-face learning. Also, students will not return to campus following the Thanksgiving break and the remainder of the fall semester. Those classes and final exams will be conducted online. A similar concept was recently unveiled by the Connecticut State Colleges and Universities system. UConn plans to take various steps to promote social distancing, including reducing the capacity of classrooms to allow 6 feet of separation, requiring the wearing of face masks, and reducing density in the residence halls located on the Storrs and Stamford campuses. The plans mirror recommendations set by Gov. Ned Lamont’s reopening committee. Katsouleas said UConn is still evaluating plans to test students for COVID-19. The state’s reopening committee has recommended Connecticut ramp up testing capacity to 200,000 tests per week by Sept. 1, in time for the expected reopening of state colleges and universities. Rehoboth Beach:A man from Lancaster, Pennsylvania, who refused to wear a mask on the boardwalk was detained and cited Monday for violating Delaware’s face-covering requirement and refusing to comply with officers, according to the police department. The department said its officers faced a “defiant lack of compliance” from the 56-year-old man over wearing a face mask, which is required while on the boardwalk and recommended on all Delaware beaches. The man told a seasonal cadet he would have to “make him” wear the mask and walked away from the officer and back onto the beach. The officer followed the man after addressing people on the boardwalk who were “now upset and yelling” at him for not wearing a mask, according to a police statement. A full-time officer joined the cadet on the beach, where they found the man and asked for his identification. The man said he didn’t have it on him, then gave them a false name and state of residence, according to the statement. The man was taken into custody and detained after “numerous warnings” for refusing to give officers further information. Face coverings have been required while on the boardwalk since May 22, under Gov. John Carney’s state of emergency and the first day Rehoboth Beach opened its beach to swimming and sunbathing. Washington: Members of the D.C. National Guard have tested positive for COVID-19 in the wake of the mass protests across the nation’s capital last week, according to Lt. Col. Brooke Davis, a Guard spokeswoman. She said the Guard will not release the exact total, but U.S. officials said they believe it is not a large number, at least so far. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to release the information publicly. The positive tests were first reported by McClatchy. Although some Guard troops responding to the protests wore protective equipment, most were not wearing masks and it was largely impossible to maintain any social distancing. In a statement, Davis said unit commanders were responsible for ensuring their troops adhered to guidelines calling for Guard members to wear protective equipment and maintain social distancing where practical. She said personnel were medically screened for the virus before their arrival, and will be screened before they leave. According to officials, about 5,000 Guard members were in D.C. for the civil unrest, including as many as 1,200 from the D.C. Guard. The remainder came from 11 states: Florida, Idaho, Indiana, Maryland, Missouri, Mississippi, New Jersey, Ohio, South Carolina, Tennessee and Utah. According to officials, Guard members returning to their home states can remain on duty status and continue to be paid for two additional weeks so that they can be in quarantine if they were at risk for coronavirus infections. Orlando: A nonprofit resort that fulfills the wishes of critically ill children is shutting its doors for the time being because of coronavirus concerns. Give Kids the World Village announced Tuesday that it was temporarily laying off most of its staff at the end of the month. A small team of workers will remain to maintain the facilities and prepare for an eventual reopening, officials said. “I can promise you that I will work tirelessly to find a way to reopen our beloved Village as soon as possible,” said Pamela Landwirth, Give Kids The World Village’s CEO. The 84-acres resort located not far from Walt Disney World provides a weeklong, cost-free vacation to children with critical illnesses and their families. With whimsical structures resembling the shape of a mushroom and storybook villages, the resort has hosted 175,000 families over three decades. Athens: ,A 225-page plan for reopening the University of Georgia campus to students this fall outlines three scenarios but tells faculty and students to be prepared even for alternatives defined by university task forces, such as changing the start and end dates for semester and altering class periods. The plan aims, in three phases, for a return to in-person instruction, for the most part, when fall semester begins in August. The report lists rules and guidelines for three possibilities – starting classes this fall with social distancing; starting completely online; and moving temporarily online after classes begin in-person again. The report details plans developed by nine “working groups” of administrators in nine areas: workplace and health safety; instruction (which included one faculty member); research; public service and outreach; student life; enrollment management; athletics; communications; and fiscal impact. The university and other Georgia colleges shut down campuses in mid-March and switched to online instruction as state leaders began to understand the threat of the COVID-19 pandemic, and campuses remain closed with remote instruction during the summer term. Honolulu: A Hawaii woman has been arrested and accused of violating the state’s mandatory 14-day quarantine for travelers arriving to the islands. Patricia L. Pian, 48, is the first returning Hawaii resident to be arrested over the quarantine by state attorney general investigators, the Hawaii COVID-19 Joint Information Center announced Tuesday. Witnesses reported seeing her swimming in the ocean a few hours after she returned to Honolulu from San Diego on May 31, the state said. “She was also seen sunbathing with her husband and walking their dog,” the state’s news release said. Pian was arrested Tuesday in the hallway of her Waikiki condominium building and charged with violating quarantine. Her bail was set at $2,000. She couldn’t immediately be reached for comment. Gov. David Ige ordered the quarantine starting March 26 to curb the spread of the virus in Hawaii. Ige has said he plans to extend the quarantine beyond June 30. Travelers arriving to the state aren’t allowed to leave their quarantine location, such as residences or hotels, for anything except medical emergencies. A quarantine for those traveling between the Hawaiian Islands will be lifted next week. Some tourists have been arrested for violating the quarantine. On Monday, 1,732 people arrived in Hawaii, according to the Hawaii Tourism Authority. During this same time last year, nearly 30,000 passengers arrived in Hawaii daily. Boise: Multiple student-athletes at Boise State University have tested positive for COVID-19 after some teams started returning to campus for workouts, the university said Monday. The university declined to say how many or what sport those athletes played, citing federal privacy laws, the Idaho Statesman reported. The Statesman previously reported that the football and women’s soccer teams started to return to campus last week for volunteer workouts. “There were multiple positives and those individuals will follow the advice of health care providers before returning to campus and joining their teams for voluntary workouts,” the university said in a statement. About 40 student-athletes underwent COVID-19 testing before voluntary workouts could begin, university spokesperson Joe Nickell said. Workouts were held Monday for those who did not test positive and passed a medical screening. “Any student-athlete that was potentially exposed will not return to campus for physicals and clearance until follow-up testing determines it is safe for them to return,” Nickell said. Chicago: City officials on Tuesday canceled Lollapalooza and other summer festivals through Labor Day, citing concerns about the spread of the new coronavirus as the pandemic’s financial toll worsened. Lollapalooza draws hundreds of thousands of people over four days to a lakefront park, generating more than $5 million for Chicago, but city officials said it was too risky with crowds packed close together. “Bringing that many people from all over the country downtown in Grant Park every single day, we might as well just light ourselves on fire,” said Mayor Lori Lightfoot. “It makes no sense given what we know about how this disease spreads.” The financial cost of the pandemic continued to climb with Lightfoot estimating a $700 million budget shortfall. The first-term mayor said Chicago will try to delay some projects, but all options to address the budget hole remain on the table, including a property tax increase. Lollapalooza officials said they understood the decision and were focused on a 30th anniversary event scheduled for 2021. Indianapolis: Students in Indiana will return to school in the coming months, but what that looks like will vary widely across the state. Following the Indiana Department of Education’s release of school reentry guidelines last week, State Superintendent Jennifer McCormick addressed teachers and administrators during a webinar Tuesday, emphasizing the freedom local leaders have to determine how their schools will operate during the coronavirus pandemic. With many schools starting the academic year by early August, some are expecting to hold all or most classes online, McCormick said. Others – especially in rural areas – plan to return to the “brick and mortar” setting as soon as possible. Numerous “hybrid schedules” are also taking shape, allowing students to alternate days spent learning in the classroom and remotely. “We’re all trying to get schools back in,” McCormick said. “We just have to remember that that’s going to look different across counties and across our state.” The reentry plan provided by the state is broad and nonmandatory, meaning it will be up to school districts to decide whether students and faculty would have to undergo health screenings, wear masks and adhere to social distancing best practices. Some schools could choose to require masks at all times, while others might elect to only require them for certain activities or not at all, McCormick said. To assist, the governor’s office is planning on purchasing 2 million masks for distribution by the state’s education department. It’s not a long-term fix, but rather a way to help out schools that will require them to be worn, she said. Des Moines: Republican legislators are fast-tracking a bill that would give meatpacking plants, nursing homes and other businesses broad immunity from coronavirus lawsuits despite criticism that it would also enable them to ignore workplace safety requirements. The bill, which the state House passed Friday with only Republican support, is supported by groups that represent hospitals and doctors, restaurants, casinos, grocery stores, bankers, meat processors, truckers and insurance companies. The American Civil Liberties Union of Iowa, labor unions and the Iowa State Bar Association are among those who oppose the measure. Republican Rep. Gary Carlson of Muscatine, who managed the bill in the House, said the owners of small businesses want to reopen but need certainty they can’t be sued by their employees. “They’re trying to follow guidelines but are scared to death they’re going to be sued by someone when they tried to do their best,” he said. Rep. Chris Hall, a Sioux City Democrat, said most businesses will work to protect customers and workers and deserve protection from frivolous lawsuits, but the broad protections in the bill also will help some hide the truth. Oklahoma, Utah and Wyoming enacted similar laws in May that were signed by Republican governors. Several other states have bills pending or have attempted similar action. U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell proposed including nationwide liability protection in a coronavirus relief bill, but his efforts so far have not succeeded. Lawrence: The University of Kansas will offer voluntary buyout packages to some faculty members as it grapples with financial losses from the coronavirus pandemic. Chancellor Douglas Girod has said the university faces a budget shortfall of at least $120 million in the fiscal year that begins July 1 because of virus-related shutdowns, the Lawrence Journal-World reported. Provost Barbara Bichelmeyer said in a Monday message to faculty and staff members that eligible employees must be age 62 or older and meet other requirements. “This was not an easy decision, however, it is one that will help enable the university to plan and forecast its continued capacity to provide high-quality educational experiences and exceptional research on our Lawrence and Edwards campuses long into the future,” Bichelmeyer said. Applicants accepted into the Voluntary Separation Incentive Program will receive a lump-sum cash payment of $100,000 or their fiscal year 2021 budgeted base salary, whichever is lower. They must retire by Dec. 31 and would not be eligible for rehire at the university for 12 months. Between 500 and 600 faculty and staff are likely eligible for the program, said university spokeswoman Erinn Barcomb-Peterson. Cave City: Mammoth Cave National Park has reopened one self-guided cave tour, officials said. The tour in the cave’s historic section is the only one accessible because of social distancing guidelines put in place because of the coronavirus pandemic, park spokeswoman Molly Schroer told the Daily News. Beginning last week, visitors have been able to walk through more than a mile of passages in the cave’s larger chambers, she said. “We are only doing this one self-guided tour because it’s bigger passageways” Schroer said, which allows for social distancing. Traditional tours had a guide that would take groups through caves telling the history and answering questions but now rangers are stationed along different points in the cave to answer questions from visitors, she said. The park has also reopened its visitor center at a reduced capacity, along with its gift shops, campgrounds and cabins. Surface trails at the park remained open through the pandemic. New Orleans: The city will let the good times roll in casinos and bars again beginning Saturday, with restrictions aimed at preventing the spread of COVID-19, Mayor LaToya Cantrell said. The city was once a major hot spot for the disease caused by the new coronavirus, and that led to the closure of entertainment venues. But the city began easing restrictions on restaurants and other businesses in May. On a Tuesday radio broadcast, Cantrel outlined plans to lift more restrictions this weekend. That means bars and casinos in the city can open – although only at 25% capacity, Cantrell said during a “Town Hall” broadcast on WBOK. Food-serving establishments, churches and movie theaters, which are already allowed to open at 25% capacity, can move to 50% capacity in the city beginning Saturday, although churches and movie theaters will have a cap of 250 people. Gatherings of 100 will be allowed for weddings and funerals, Cantrell said. And tattoo parlors will be allowed to open. However, another New Orleans cultural touchstone – live music in bars and music halls – will remain off limits. And churches will have to meet without choirs. City health director Jennifer Avegno said that exhaling one’s breath during singing could help spread the virus. Also remaining off limits for now: Festivals, fairs, amusement parks and arcades. Augusta: A medical products company confirmed the destruction of a limited number of specialized swabs for coronavirus testing because of President Donald Trump’s visit. But that was the plan all along, the company said. Puritan Medical Products had a limited production run on Friday to provide a demonstration for the president and his entourage. The company discarded those swabs after the visit, officials said. Normal production that day was shifted to the weekend so weekly output was unaffected, the company said. The facility was thoroughly cleaned and sanitized after the president’s visit, it said. The company also noted that all of its swabs are sterilized after production as part of the normal process.“We were glad to have the opportunity for our role in addressing the global health pandemic be recognized by the president and other senior government officials,” the company said. Puritan is in the process of doubling production with federal assistance to ensure an adequate supply of the swabs as the nation ramps up testing for the new cornonavirus. Salisbury:Maryland Canvas, a Somerset County company that has been producing face masks during the coronavirus pandemic, is among 25 Maryland businesses that have received a slice of $1.6 million grants for pivoting to or expanding personal protective equipment production. Through the Maryland COVID-19 Emergency Relief Manufacturing Fund administered by the Maryland Department of Commerce, companies are receiving grants of up to $100,000 to manufacture critically needed items, including face shields, gowns and N95 mask parts. The first round of grants, awarded in May, went to 20 Maryland companies, including Hardwire LLC of Pocomoke City. Boston: The city is offering those who were involved in protests following the death of George Floyd access to coronavirus testing. Mayor Marty Walsh said in a news conference Wednesday that his administration is reaching out to organizers of the demonstrations and is working to create a mobile pop-up testing site in the Boston neighborhood of Roxbury that will be open to everyone, whether or not they are showing signs of COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus. “There is no special screening or requirements,” Walsh said. “As people lift their voices to fight racism and injustice, we want to make sure that we keep them safe as well.” Many, but not all, of the protesters were wearing masks, which can help stem the spread of the virus. Walsh said he was concerned for the health of the protesters and also the possibility that they could bring the virus home and cause others to become sick. Lansing: Restaurants and bars could sell cocktails and other liquor for pickup or delivery and would see a temporary cut in state liquor prices under legislation overwhelmingly approved by state Senate on Wednesday. Supporters said the bill would help bars and restaurants amid the coronavirus pandemic, noting that some already can sell unopened beer and wine to go if they have a certain license. Under the legislation, on-premises licensees could fill and sell containers with beer, wine, mixed drinks or liquor for off-site consumption. Through 2021, they would see a 30% discount on liquor bought from the state instead of a 17% discount. Local governments could designate a “social district” where people could drink alcohol outside. “It provides more options for our bar and restaurant friends that have struggled so hard the last few months. It provides them a little bit more of a chance to survive,” said the bill sponsor, Republican Sen. Aric Nesbitt of Lawton. Sauk Rapids:Businesses in the city can apply for up to $5,000 in grant funds to help them adapt to evolving state rules as they reopen during the COVID-19 pandemic. The grant program through the city’s Housing and Redevelopment Authority was approved June 4 and is available for restaurants with 75 or fewer employees or other businesses with 25 or fewer employees, said Community Development Director Todd Schultz. Businesses can use the grant dollars to purchase patio furniture and tents for restaurants to serve customers outdoors, plastic shields to protect employees at points of sale and anything else needed to comply with coronavirus rules. “Basically, we’re paying for ... extraordinary expenses that people have had to endure because of the pandemic,” Schultz said. Sauk Rapids’ downtown area has been a major investment for 15 years, he said. “It’s very important that we do what we can to help businesses weather the storm as much as possible.” The grants will be awarded out of the Housing and Redevelopment authority general fund for eligible expenses made after March 15. That fund draws on many different sources of revenue, including old tax increment financing and various loan funds, he said. Jackson:A national restaurant chain has permanently closed one of its restaurants in the Jackson metro are amid the COVID-19 pandemic. CraftWorks Holdings LLC, which operates Logan’s Roadhouse, closed 261 of the restaurant’s locations in April, according to a report by The Tennessean. The Logan’s Roadhouse on 600 E. County Line Road in Ridgeland had locks and chains on all of its doors on Monday. It is among the restaurants that closed permanently, according to a phone recording. However, CraftWorks Holdings’ still has some Logan’s Roadhouse, franchise-owned locations open. The message encouraged callers to visit other locations in Pearl and Flowood. CraftWorks filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in early March and laid off 18,000 employees. St. Louis: Three major hotels in the St. Louis metropolitan area have told the state they are laying off or furloughing more than 900 employees after the COVID-19 pandemic crippled travel. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Clayton laid off or furloughed 307 of the location’s 325 employees. Hyatt Regency St. Louis permanently laid off 51 employees, furloughed 149 employees without benefits, and extended 45 furloughs with employee benefits. The Marriott St. Louis Grand laid off, furloughed or reduced working hours for all 384 employees. All three said the cuts were necessitated by the sudden and unprecedented economic effects of the COVID-19 crisis. The Ritz and the Marriott told the state in letters this week they couldn’t estimate the lengths of the furloughs. On Friday, local hotelier Lodging Hospitality Management said it would lay off more than 1,000 hotel workers. Those included five hotels in St. Louis, three in Maryland Heights, two in Chesterfield and one each in Edmondson and O’Fallon. Kalispell: The western side of Glacier National Park has reopened to visitors after being closed since late March to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus. Park officials lifted the barriers into the park Monday and reopened Going-to-the-Sun Road to Lake McDonald Lodge by 8 a.m., the Hungry Horse News reported. The park is expected to close early each day at 4:30 p.m. until more employees return from quarantine status, park spokeswoman Gina Kerzman said. The park will not sweep trails and force people to leave, but it will stop letting more people in when the gates close, she said. Entrance fees were originally waived, but are required for future visits and can be purchased online, Kerzman said. Trails accessible from U.S. Highway 2 will also be open and will close at 4:30 p.m., including Walton and the Autumn Creek Trail at Marias Pass. The Polebridge entrance to the park will remain close and the Camas Road will not be open next week to begin pavement sealing and other work as part of an effort to seal all the paved roads in the park, officials said. Back-country camping will also not initially be available, but could begin around June 20, the park’s website said. Campground reservations across the park are also closed, many because of staffing concerns. The east side of the park will remain closed until the Blackfeet Tribe lifts its travel ban, which is set to expire June 30. The park has deferred to the tribe and its health concerns by closing east-side roads, trails and campgrounds. Visitors should expect plenty of mud and some flooded low-level trails due to recent heavy rains, officials said. A thunderstorm on May 31 caused a three-day power outage and knocked down numerous trees that officials are still working to clean up. Omaha: At least five soldiers and one police officer who helped with crowd control at recent protests in Omaha and Lincoln have tested positive for the new coronavirus, officials said. Nearly 600 members of the Nebraska National Guard were assigned to assist law enforcement agencies beginning May 31 following several nights of protests in Nebraska after the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. The National Guard announced earlier this week that it would test all of its personnel who had been on duty in Omaha and Lincoln after two members tested positive. The Nebraska National Guard said Tuesday that a total of five of its members who worked the protests have now tested positive. The Lincoln Police Department said one officer also tested positive. Nebraska prisons officials meanwhile announced that another prison staffer tested positive for the virus, bringing the total number of staffers infected across the state prison system to 19. The state Department of Correctional Services also announced late Tuesday that it would offer coronavirus testing to all state inmates, even those who don’t have symptoms. Reno: A federal judge ruled Tuesday against the leaders of two Nevada churches who argued that the state’s coronavirus-related restrictions on religious gatherings are an unconstitutional violation of their First Amendment rights. U.S. District Judge Richard Boulware II denied requests from a church in rural Lyon County and another in Las Vegas that sought temporary injunctions to void the state’s 50-person cap on attendance at church services. Attorneys for Calvary Chapel Dayton Valley in Dayton, near Reno, and Calvary Chapel Lone Mountain in Las Vegas argued that they are being treated unfairly compared to casinos and other businesses. They wanted the judge to lift the 50-person cap and instead subject the churches to the less-stringent limits placed on casinos and other businesses that are allowed to reopen at 50% of building capacity under social distancing protocols. Boulware said the churches could perhaps in the future prove there has been a pattern of intentionally enforcing COVID-19 restrictions in a way that singles out religious gatherings. But he said there’s not enough evidence yet to warrant the court’s involvement. Both churches claimed they’re being treated unfairly, partly because they said the state is failing to enforce social distancing guidelines to prevent the spread of COVID-19 at casinos and during recent protests over policing and race. Concord: The state is forming a work group to start developing guidance for outdoor visits by appointment at long-term care centers, Health and Human Services Commissioner Lori Shibinette said Tuesday. Shibinette said the group would be meeting this week into early next week. The facilities have been closed to visitors. More than a dozen of them have experienced coronavirus outbreaks, and their residents make up the majority of those who have died of the virus in the state. Some homes have since been removed from the list. Outdoor visits would be considered at facilities that are not experiencing an outbreak. Shibinette said there has to be a balance between the physical health of seniors and their quality of life. Many seniors are dealing with social isolation. “We want them to engage with their families, their grandchildren, their children,” and talk with their peers over lunch and dinner, she said. Trenton:Gov. Phil Murphy hopes to deploy an additional 1,600 people by the end of June to help local agencies with the grueling work of contract tracing – calling up individuals who spent more than 10 minutes within 6 feet of an individual who tested positive for COVID-19 and might be at risk. New Jersey will add 1,500 more tracers by the end of July if needed, Murphy said. “Contact tracing takes on a new urgency especially against a virus we are still learning about and have no defense against,” Murphy said Wednesday, outlining publicly for the first time the state’s contact tracing plan and timeline. More than six weeks have passed since Murphy said contact tracing – along with robust testing and ability to isolate cases – was needed before New Jersey establishments could reopen. A patchwork of close to 100 underfunded and understaffed local health departments were left to assemble volunteers on their own to handle a surge in thousands of cases in mid-April, and brace for another possible increase in cases as Murphy lifts restrictions on businesses, parks, restaurants and more before providing meaningful assistance to these localities. These agencies expressed concern the state would replace the infrastructure they built on their own, but Murphy said Wednesday that “we have no desire to uproot them or overstep them,” referring to local health departments. Santa Fe: State officials are setting aside time slots for food industry workers for COVID-19 testing at numerous New Mexico Department of Health field offices statewide. The Department of Health said the testing time slots from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m. each Monday will be for people who work at establishments such as restaurants, grocery stories, farmers markets, distribution centers and food manufacturing facilities. The department said the effort should help identify, isolate and trace new cases. The department’s announcement noted that many people infected with the coronavirus might not experience symptoms but still have potential to pass the virus. Cities where participating offices are located include Albuquerque, Bernalillo, Gallup, Farmington, Belen, Santa Fe, Espanola, Los Alamos, Santa Rosa and Raton. Others include Artesia, Carlsbad, Clovis, Ft. Sumner, Hobbs’, Lovington, Portales, Roswell, Ruidoso, Tucumcari, Las Cruces, Anthony, Sunland Park, Silver City, Alamogordo and Socorro. Albany: New York is now allowing nursing homes in some parts of the state to test staff for COVID-19 only once a week, down from a sweeping twice-a-week mandate that began last month. State Health Commissioner Howard Zucker said Wednesday that infection rates had fallen to the point where less rigorous testing was acceptable. Gov. Andrew Cuomo ordered the testing regime May 10 to belatedly stop the uncontrolled spread of the new coronavirus through nursing homes. To date, at least 6,100 nursing home residents have died in the state. Homes will be able to reduce testing to once a week in parts of the state that have begun the second phase of the state’s reopening plan. Twice-a-week testing would continue in New York City, which entered the first phase of reopening Monday. Leaders of nursing homes and their industry groups argued for weeks that mandatory testing was costly and logistically difficult, requiring roughly 185,000 workers to get tested twice a week. Zucker said said the program has been a success. More than 6,500 tests on nursing home staff have come up positive for COVID-19, he said. Raleigh: State prison inmates are likely facing unlawful “cruel or unusual punishments” in part because correction officials have failed to offer widespread COVID-19 testing within all correctional facilities, a judge said. Superior Court Judge Vince Rozier, hearing a lawsuit filed by prisoners and civil rights advocates, wrote this week he would issue an order telling the plaintiffs and the state prison system to come up with a plan by June 22 to test all prisoners. He did not provide a deadline to complete testing. Prison leaders have kept to a policy whereby mass testing has occurred when an outbreak in an individual prison warranted it. So far, facility-wide testing has occurred in two of the state’s 50-plus prisons, both of which house prisoners in open dormitories. Overall, nearly 2,000 tests have been completed in a prison system with more than 30,000 inmates, with almost 700 testing positive and five virus-related inmate deaths. Most of those testing positive are now presumed recovered. In a memo, Rozier said he’s worried about disparate COVID-19 actions taking place at each prison and also wants a plan to address those differences. In a statement released Tuesday, the Department of Public Safety said it was consulting with state attorneys to determine next steps in the case. Bismarck: More than a third of North Dakota’s long-term care facilities have received state approval to begin reopening. Eighty-two of the 218 facilities have completed testing to qualify for the first phase of reopening. Visitation at nursing homes and assisted living facilities has been restricted since April 6 because of the coronavirus pandemic. Gov. Doug Burgum on June 5 announced visits could resume, but in phases. The Bismarck Tribune said the first phase of the state’s three-phase plan allows outdoor visitation with proper safeguards such as masks and physical distancing. It allows for communal dining to resume and limited group activities for residents Phase 2 involves resuming indoor visitation with restrictions and Phase 3 is fully opened visitation with screening of visitors. Moving into those phases will depend on several factors, including a county’s case status and whether there are active cases in a facility. Health officials said long-term care facilities in North Dakota have had 53 coronavirus-related deaths since the beginning of the pandemic. Cincinnati:The Cincinnati Zoo & Botanical Garden reopened Wednesday after being shut down for nearly three months because of the coronavirus pandemic. For visitors and animals to co-mingle again, precautions the zoo took, triggered by the pandemic, went beyond visitors, said Dean Violetta, the zoo’s planning and exhibit design director. With the help of Krista Powers, the pair spent the past 21/2 months working out the kinks of the zoo’s reopening. Social distancing isn’t just key for people, Violetta said, some animals require it as well. In collaboration with other zoos nationwide, the Cincinnati Zoo looked at which animals – such as the big cats – were more susceptible to the virus. Additional barriers were constructed to make sure the guests and animals were safe. “We looked at everything from a 60,000-foot level,” Violetta said. Other staff tackled ticketing, technology and cleaning protocol, among other aspects. “It’s a different zoo today,” he said, “But we’ll get there.” Oklahoma City: There are 117 new coronavirus cases in Oklahoma and two additional deaths, the Oklahoma State Department of Health reported Wednesday. There have been at least 7,480 confirmed cases and 355 deaths in the state, up from 7,363 cases and 353 deaths reported Tuesday. The actual number of people who have contracted a virus is likely higher because many people have not been tested, and studies suggest people can be infected and not feel sick. A total of 6,166 people have recovered from the illness and 150 are hospitalized, according to the department. Salem: Gov. Kate Brown said the state is working to implement a plan to test all staff and residents at long-term care facilities for the new coronavirus. Testing will start at care centers at the highest risk of having an outbreak. Most of those facilities are in Multnomah, Washington, Clackamas, Yamhill, Marion and Polk counties, according to the governor’s office. “From the beginning of this pandemic, it has been one of my top priorities to protect the residents and staff of long-term care facilities,” Brown said in a statement. Care centers in Oregon have been hit with outbreaks throughout the pandemic. As of Tuesday, out of the state’s 688 large long term-care facilities, 16 have confirmed coronavirus cases, the governor’s office said. Previously, it had been 27 facilities. The disease especially impacts older adults and people with existing health problems as it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia and death. At least 169 people across Oregon have died from the virus and more than 4,980 in the state have tested positive for the disease. Currently long-term care facilities are restricting visitation of nonessential visitors and screening essential individuals before entering the building. Harrisburg: Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf and the GOP-led Legislature headed toward a legal clash Wednesday over the emergency declaration he issued at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, with lawmakers voting to end it and Wolf insisting he holds veto power. In largely party-line votes, the Legislature approved late Tuesday to end Wolf’s 3-month-old emergency proclamation and restarting businesses and other activities shut down as COVID-19 began tightening its grip on Pennsylvania. Retailers and many other kinds of businesses have since been permitted to reopen, but with restrictions. Supporters of the resolution – which they asserted would do away with many, if not all, pandemic restrictions – maintained that state law authorizes the Legislature to end the emergency declaration unilaterally. Wolf believes that still requires his support and vowed Wednesday to fight the resolution in court. House leadership also threatened legal action. “If the governor chooses to openly violate the plain reading of the law, we will examine all legal actions available to us to act in the best interest of the residents of the commonwealth,” House Majority Leader Bryan Cutler, R-Lancaster, said in a news release Wednesday. In an earlier letter to House members, Wolf said the resolution that cleared the Legislature would put federal funding at risk and “cripple the commonwealth’s ability to procure resources quickly and decisively.” Wolf’s office said he will “disapprove” the resolution if it makes it to his desk, but argued that much of the shutdown would not be affected. Providence: The state plans to have schoolchildren and teachers back in the classroom for face-to-face instruction starting Aug. 31, Gov. Gina Raimondo said Wednesday. Although the state’s remote learning plan during the coronavirus pandemic has been one of the most successful in the nation, “There is no substitute for in-person learning,” the Democrat said at a news conference. The date was set based on data trends regarding the virus that indicate reopening schools will be safe then, but there will be some flexibility. Schools will look different, she said, with desks spaced farther apart, more frequent cleaning, fewer children on buses, and children and teachers likely wearing masks. Children who are sick, even with a minor sniffle, will be required to stay home. The Rhode Island Department of Education will on June 19 post its minimum safety requirements that all public and private schools must meet. Each district must then submit a reopening plan to the state based on those minimum standards by July 17, Raimondo said. To help schools offset anticipated increased costs, the state will provide at least $42 million in federal coronavirus aid, she said. Greenville: Health officials reported an additional 116 cases of COVID-19 in Greenville County on Monday to mark the 11th consecutive day that the Upstate “hot spot” has led South Carolina in new cases. The state Department of Health and Environmental Control tallied a total of 542 new cases of COVID-19 and 11 more deaths across South Carolina. It was the highest single-day total for new cases since the pandemic began in March. The previous one-day high came Saturday, 512 new cases. Also Monday, DHEC reported the highest number of COVID-19 hospitalizations yet, 507. That total tops the 502 hospitalizations on May 8. And as testing has increased throughout the state, so has the percentage of positive results, more than doubling from 3% to about 8% over the past 28 days. Dr. Brannon Traxler said during a news briefing Monday that the ongoing spike in cases, increasing hospitalizations and rising percentage of positive tests all point to the same conclusion. “There is disease continuing to be spread and increasing in its spread, especially compared to several weeks ago,” said Traxler, who lives in Greenville. “However, I don’t think we are at a point where we need to be panicking.” Traxler urged South Carolina residents to modify their behavior. “It doesn’t take any hard data to notice that a lot of people across South Carolina are not doing the social distancing and are not avoiding group gatherings and wearing masks,” she said. Sioux Falls: One more person has died from COVID-19 in South Dakota, and 81 more people have confirmed cases, state health officials reported Wednesday. The state has seen a total of 69 people die from COVID-19. The most recent death reported is a man over the age of 80 from Beadle County. The total number of COVID-19 cases in the state stands at 5,604. There are 101 people who are hospitalized. More than 81% of people with confirmed cases have recovered, but health officials reported that 962 people statewide still have active infections. Nashville: Attorneys for voting rights groups want Tennessee officials held in contempt of court over claims they have not immediately let all Tennessee voters get ballots to vote by mail during the coronavirus pandemic as ordered. The state, in turn, has contended it is complying and the groups are citing outdated instructions for local election officials. That fight over whether Tennessee officials are meeting their obligations on the court-ordered absentee voting option for all 4.1 million of Tennessee’s registered voters is headed for a hearing Thursday in Nashville. At the same time, the state is also fighting to have the expansion blocked on appeal. In a Davidson County Chancery Court filing Monday night, plaintiffs attorneys wrote that the judge didn’t order the state to create a new form with a COVID-19 option, though it still did. The judge’s ruling directed voters to select an existing illness and disability box. The new option stated, “I have determined it is impossible or unreasonable to vote in-person due to the COVID-19 situation, and therefore qualify as hospitalized, ill, or disabled and unable to appear at my polling place.” The filing points out there’s no explanation of what constitutes “impossible or unreasonable.” The court’s ruling came down Jan. 4, and Tennessee Elections Coordinator Mark Goins told local elections officials in an email Jan. 5 that the state had been “working all day to ensure compliance.” Austin: The state on Wednesday reported a third consecutive day with a record number of patients hospitalized with COVID-19, as a new rise in coronavirus cases ripples across states nationwide. The upward trend comes six weeks into Texas’ reopening that began in May, which kicked off one of the fastest reboots of daily life in the U.S, and as restaurants get permission to expand their dining rooms to nearly full capacity starting Friday. Although thousands of hospital beds remain available, officials are voicing concern. Throughout the record-setting week in Texas, Gov. Greg Abbott and state health officials have pointed out hots pots in rural counties with meatpacking plants and prisons but have not offered an explanation for rising caseloads elsewhere. But on Wednesday, some city officials and health experts readily linked the worsening numbers to businesses reopening and people growing more complacent with social distancing. “This is a concerning trend,” said Dr. Mark Escott, the interim health authority for Austin Public Health in the Texas capital. Surrounding Travis County set a record Tuesday with 161 new cases, nearly double its previous single-day high. Abbott reiterated that he was “concerned but not alarmed” in Texas. He has not signaled any intention of putting social or business restrictions back in place and urged residents to continue wearing masks, sanitizing their hands and maintaining social distancing. Logan: Workers at a meatpacking plant and their supporters protested the company’s handling of a coronavirus outbreak that has resulted in nearly 300 confirmed cases. JBS USA employees held a demonstration in Logan on Tuesday against conditions at the plant in Hyrum. The Bear River Health Department said 287 JBS workers tested positive for the virus at a May 30 screening. About 100 employees walked out of the JBS parking lot Monday morning. A group of about 30 gathered in downtown Logan on Tuesday with signs decrying the company’s treatment of workers. “They are making it seem like money is more important than our lives,” Monique Ramos said. “We produce meat for everyone across the country. We deserve to be valued.” JBS spokesperson Nikki Richardson said the company is following guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration regarding social distancing. Workers who tested positive May 30 could return to work Wednesday if they did not have coronavirus symptoms, Richardson said. “No one is forced to come to work, and no one is punished for being absent for health reasons,” Richardson said. “If any team member is fearful of coming to work they can call the company and inform us, and they will receive unpaid leave.” Montpelier: The state is able to safely open its schools to in-person instruction in the fall, with safety measures and guidelines that will be published next week, Education Secretary Dan French said Wednesday. “We recognize that as much as COVID-19 has been an unprecedented public health emergency, in many cases it has been an education emergency,” he said. Among the safety measures, all students and staff will have a daily health check, including a temperature screening, when they get to school, he said. Staff will be required to wear facial coverings and students will be encouraged to do so when appropriate, French said. Disinfection and hygiene protocols will also be included in the guidance, he said. If a school or schools need to close because of an outbreak, the state is planning to improve its remote learning. Staunton:A part-time staff member of the Staunton-Augusta Family YMCA has tested positive for COVID-19, according to a release. The part-time employee was working for the YMCA's June 12 reopening, the release said. The employee has been quarantined and the YMCA hired a professional cleaning crew to disinfect facilities, the release said. YMCA executive director Josh Cole said he is working closely with with local health department officials on how to move forward. “Our main concern is for the safety of the individual, our staff, our members and our community,"" Cole said in a release. ""We'll follow the lead of the health department officials to make sure we are ensuring safety for everyone involved.” The Staunton-Augusta Family YMCA has pushed back its expected opening date to June 19. Yakima: The coronavirus pandemic continues to rage in Yakima County, with the total number of cases closing in on 5,000. The Yakima Health District reported 215 more infections Monday, bringing the total of confirmed cases to 4,929. The Yakima Herald-Republic reported deaths from COVID-19 remained at 96. “We are a hot spot for COVID-19,” health district spokeswoman Lilian Bravo said. She said it’s too early to tell what kind of impact recent public gatherings in support of Black Lives Matter might have on the spread of the virus because it can take up to 14 days before symptoms become apparent. “We need to start taking it more seriously,” Bravo said. “We have to commit as a community and take responsibility for our own actions to protect the community as a whole.” The county’s infection rate is more than 537 per 100,000 people over 14 days. Huntington: Marshall University employees are continuing to return to their workplaces on the university’s campuses and at its centers in southern West Virginia, the university said. The second phase of the return began this week, and the school welcomed up to 50% of workers back. The plan was developed to address protocols stemming from the coronavirus pandemic. The four-phase plan began May 26. The last phase is set for July 6, when up to 100% of the school’s department personnel will be back on site. Contingency plans are included to address any localized outbreaks of the virus and options for high-risk employees, the school said in a news release. Wisconsin Rapids:A paper-making company announced Tuesday that it plans to close mills in Minnesota and Wisconsin because the coronavirus pandemic has depressed demand. The Wisconsin Rapids Tribune reported the Verso Corporation plans to close its mill in Duluth by the end of June and its mill in Wisconsin Rapids by the end of the July. The company expects to lay off 1,000 employees between the two mills, although some will continue working after July 31 to continue limited operations or maintenance. About 900 of the layoffs will come at the Wisconsin Rapids facility. The company said a decline in demand for graphic paper because of the pandemic forced the move. Retail, sports, entertainment and tourism industries have reduced their use of print advertising during stay-at-home orders, according to a statement from Verso. Demand fell by 38% in April, the company said. The mills could restart if market conditions improve, the company said. Wisconsin Rapids Mayor Shane Blaser called the announcement “devastating.” The Wisconsin Paper Council released a statement calling the decision disappointing fro the entire paper industry. Wisconsin state Rep. Scott Krug, a Nekoosa Republican, called the layoffs a “horrendous side effect from the outbreak.” Cody: A surge in one county has boosted the number of coronavirus cases in Wyoming. Uinta County in southwestern Wyoming has confirmed 11 new cases of the virus in just one day, bringing the county’s total number of confirmed cases to 32, according to the Wyoming Department of Health. The local surge raised Wyoming’s total count of laboratory-confirmed cases to 760. Of those, 600 people have recovered. Meanwhile, the number of people killed by COVID-19 in Wyoming rose Tuesday to 18 with the death of an adult woman from Fremont County. A fourth resident of a Washakie County nursing home died in Montana and will be added to that state’s total. Outside Uinta County, new infections in Wyoming were low, with no more than two new cases in any county on Tuesday. In Park County, where testing has confirmed just two cases, analysis of sewage collected from the city’s wastewater system April 28 and May 31 have showed no signs of the virus, the Cody Enterprise reported."
47,47,Family of man shot by New Jersey state trooper 'outraged' at video release timingGeorge Woolston ,"Jun. 10, 2020",https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/06/09/maurice-gordon-family-man-shot-state-trooper-outraged-ag/5325523002/,"BASS RIVER, N.J. – The attorney representing the family of a New York man shot and killed by a New Jersey State Police trooper says the New Jersey Attorney General’s Office did not give the family enough opportunity to see video of the incident before it was released publicly Monday. The AG’s Office says it offered multiple ways for the family to see the footage and listen to other recordings related to the May 23 conflict, which were not taken. The conflict is the latest step in an incident which began gaining national attention over the weekend when the family of 28-year-old Maurice Gordon called on New Jersey officials to provide information regarding his death, and in the wake of national protests regarding instances of police brutality and the Black Lives Matter movement. Their calls were echoed by politicians and community members, and #justiceformaurice was trending on social media. Video:Struggle before New Jersey state trooper shot New York man The victim Gordon was pronounced dead roughly 28 hours after he left his friend’s Poughkeepsie, New York home. The friend promptly called 911 distraught over how Gordon was acting. That phone call was among the recordings released Monday, in addition to video of the confrontation between Gordon and state trooper Sgt. Randall Wetzel, that depicts a traffic stop and a physical struggle along the Garden State Parkway. On Monday, attorney William O. Wagstaff said Gordon’s mother and sister was “outraged” they could not watch the footage before it was released.  “They were hurt. They were beside themselves. Both of them were in my arms crying uncontrollably. Because of what they felt was the further victimization of this family,” Wagstaff said. Wagstaff said the attorney’s general office made an “unreasonable request” on short notice for Gordon’s family to travel from New York to offices in Whippany, New Jersey, to view the footage in person Monday. The attorney said after denying that request, the attorney general’s office emailed him a link to the footage, and he requested for them to wait until he could show the family. “It was radio silent for a matter of hours, it's released to the public and the family is receiving text messages from people saying that they believe that it is on YouTube,” Wagstaff said. “So it wasn't important to release it to the family for the last two weeks. But now all of a sudden that there is pressure from the media and the public, you now have this sense of urgency to get it out to the media, without giving the opportunity to the family to grieve and review with themselves. It's disgusting,” Wagstaff continued. According to a spokesperson for the attorney general’s office, Wagstaff was contacted Sunday to make clear that the AG’s Office of Public Integrity and Accountability, the division handling the investigation, intended to release the footage Monday. The family was invited to view the footage in OPIA’s offices prior to the release, and after that offer was declined, the spokesperson said OPIA provided the family’s lawyer with a link to the footage to view privately before its public release. The AG’s office said Monday morning it was ready to release the recordings at authorities were substantially done that part of their investigation, even though the probe is still ongoing. Gordon was studying chemistry at Dutchess Community College and worked as an Uber driver. It is not known yet what he was doing in South Jersey on May 23, Wagstaff said, noting it was possible he could have had an Uber fare. The AG’s Office released information tracing Gordon’s contact with authorities over more than a day before the shooting. The traffic stop was the culmination of five “episodes,” as described by the attorney general’s office, which began with a 911 call from a friend to police in Poughkeepsie around 3:30 a.m. EDT on May 22. “He came in and he looked really panicked and everything,” the friend can be heard telling a 911 dispatcher in an audio filed released by the attorney general’s office. “He just said he was going for a drive, he wouldn’t tell me where he was going. He looked very, very panicked … he said something about a paranormal experience.” The friend said he was worried about him, calling Gordon ""a completely harmless guy,"" and ""a devout Christian. He has a Bible in his car."" Over 24 hours later, Gordon’s black Honda Civic would run out of gas along the Garden State Parkway in New Jersey. An off-duty police officer and an off-duty state trooper would pull over to assist Gordon before an on-duty state trooper would arrive at the scene. After a tow truck provided Gordon with gas, and nearly two hours later, Gordon would run out of gas again along the parkway. After a state trooper arrived to call a tow truck to assist Gordon, a passerby offered to take Gordon to a nearby Wawa. When he got back to his car after the Wawa trip, Gordon continued driving southbound. At 6:13 a.m., Gordon was pulled over by a state trooper for allegedly driving 101 mph. He was issued a speeding ticket. He would be pulled over again within 20 minutes in Bass River, New Jersey. Gordon’s car broke down as a result of the stop, and he was waiting in the back of Wetzel’s patrol car for the tow truck to arrive. After several minutes in the back of the patrol car, the trooper offers him a mask and as Wetzel is giving it to him Gordon exits the vehicle. Wetzel can be heard commanding Gordon to get back in the car before Gordon attempts to enter into the driver’s seat of the patrol car, according to the recording. A fight follows, and at one point Wetzel said pepper spray was deployed. Gordon tries to get into the patrol car again before Wetzel pulls him away. The video shows the two fighting on the shoulder before six shots are fired. According to investigative documents released, Wetzel claimed Gordon attempted to grab his handgun. The documents also note that Gordon was unarmed. “We got in a fight on the side of the road. He tried running into my car .... He grabbed my gun. We were fighting with my gun and I shot him,” Wetzel is heard saying over the radio following the shooting. According to the attorney general’s release, two state troopers attempted to provide aid to Gordon before he was pronounced dead at the scene by EMS around 7:28 a.m. George Floyd live updates:Burial is Tuesday The Office of the Chief Medical Examiner has not yet completed its medical examination report, the attorney general’s office said, including any conclusions about Gordon’s time of death. The findings of that report will be shared with Gordon’s immediate family when it’s completed. The incident is being investigated by the attorney general’s Integrity Bureau within the Office of Public Integrity and Accountability and the New Jersey State Police Major Crime Bureau. A 2019 law requires the Attorney General’s Office to investigate deaths that occur during an encounter with a law enforcement officer acting in the officer’s official capacity or while the decedent is in custody. Once the investigation is complete, the case will be presented to a grand jury to make the ultimate decision regarding whether criminal charges will be filed. Wagstaff said both he and the family have not yet had the opportunity to view all of the footage, but he believes there is substantially more footage that has not been released. He also called for an independent prosecutor when the case is presented to a grand jury. “The course of action is continue to be supportive of the family, continue to call on the state of New Jersey to have a truly impartial investigation and presentation of the evidence to the grand jury,” Wagstaff said. “Here you have the state police being investigated by the state's attorney. It should not be.” The Administrative Office of the Courts has temporarily suspended the convening of grand juries due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

48,48,Three Oklahoma State football players test positive for coronavirusScott Wright ,"Jun. 3, 2020",https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaf/big12/2020/06/03/oklahoma-state-football-three-players-test-positive-coronavirus/3135339001/,"STILLWATER, Okla. — Oklahoma State’s plan of action for handling positive COVID-19 tests among its football players who returned to campus on Monday is immediately being put to the test. An Oklahoma State official says three players tested positive for COVID-19 in the first phase of testing to bring athletes back to campus, which began Monday. Senior linebacker Amen Ogbongbemiga posted the news of his positive test on Twitter on Tuesday night. OSU senior associate athletic director Kevin Klintworth posted further details on Twitter on Wednesday morning, saying that OSU tested more than 150 staff members, administrators and student-athletes “with 3 asymptomatic positives. All by (student-athletes). Positives were expected and the plan for that scenario has been activated. We will be as forthcoming as possible on the covid issues.” Additionally, freshman players who were initially scheduled to move in this weekend were notified by email or text message that their report date has been delayed until further notice, two sources told The Oklahoman. Oklahoma coach Lincoln Riley:'All lives can't matter until the black lives do too' University president Burns Hargis followed with a statement emailed to all students regarding the safety measures the school is focusing on prior to other students arriving. “It will be an interesting semester as we continue to adjust to the COVID-19 pandemic,” Hargis wrote. “Our overriding commitment is to protect the health and well-being of all members of the OSU community.” Hargis laid out the details for student testing for COVID-19, and the cleaning protocols being put in place. And he stressed his plan for a full football season. “While the pandemic has kept us apart, the fall semester will bring us together,” he wrote. OSU developed a task force to oversee athletes returning to campus, and the guidelines passed down from the task force include how to treat the athletes with positive test results. They will be quarantined in separate housing designated by OSU for quarantine purposes, where they will continue to be monitored and treated by team physicians, athletic training staff and other medical consultants. The university will also conduct contact tracing, and those players who were in contact with the infected athlete will be instructed to quarantine as well. After the quarantine period, all athletes will be retested for COVID-19 prior to resuming activities. Ogbongbemiga is the only publicly known player with a positive test result. “After attending a protest in Tulsa and being well protective of myself, I have tested positive for COVID-19,” he said on Twitter. “Please, if you are going to protest, take care of yourself and stay safe.” On Wednesday afternoon, he clarified his initial comments to say he did not know if he was infected at the protest in Tulsa on Sunday evening. His initial goal was to “make people aware (COVID-19) is still out there,” he wrote. “I was completely asymptomatic and unaware I had it, but I felt it was necessary to increase awareness that there may be many more people like myself out there. “Thankfully, I had protected myself to possibly curb the spread. I wanted to continue encouraging people still protesting to do the same.”   "
49,49,Why students should forget the coronavirus gap year to take an essential job insteadBrent Orrell ,"Jun. 5, 2020",https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2020/06/05/why-students-can-learn-more-essential-job-than-gap-year-column/3143208001/,"Growing up in Oregon, I worked on a potato farm moving 30-pound, 20-foot aluminum sections of irrigation pipe across what seemed like an ocean of plants producing what eventually became bags of potato chips. It was hot, dirty, back-breaking work that often ran to 10 or more hours a day. I still struggle with a farm-related back injury I got at 16 and have to monitor fair skin for sun damage and cancer. Many people romanticize farm life; I do not. Mostly, I feel lucky that after that job, I never had to work outdoors again for a living.  However, those years did teach me to appreciate the people who do essential jobs in our economy. It is impossible for me to look at the men and women who pave our roads, pick our produce, build our houses, and extract our coal and oil from the ground without feeling a sense of gratitude in part because of memories of hard, physical labor. This came to mind in reflecting on the challenges that our high school and college students and graduates face as they consider their options in the worst job market since the 1930s. As it could take a while for colleges to resume normal operation and the job market to recover, young people should take time to consider other options. Instead of a “gap year” where learning takes the form of travel, students ought to consider an “essential job year” spent taking on a different kind of work than what they might have considered before. Share your coronavirus story: Contact USA TODAY Opinion's hotline. We may publish your comments. In normal times, college graduates usually gravitate toward cities and suburbs where they can find jobs that help them leverage their degrees into higher wages. This has led to the “big sort” where those with higher incomes and levels of education find themselves in less and less contact with those who do “essential” jobs. Manual labor used to be much more common and helped to create a shared social understanding for work. In 1900, factories and farms employed 60 percent of the workforce; today that figure is less than 10 percent. An “essential job year” would allow people in Belmont to gain a better understanding of life and work in Fishtown.   In addition to building empathy and connection, recent research suggests that diverse experiences are good for career exploration and skill building. In his recent book, ""Range: Why Generalists Triumph in a Specialized World,"" David Epstein looks at how rapid technological change and a highly integrated global economy has increased the value of diverse experiences and broad skill sets over narrower ones. An “essential job” can teach young people skills in relating to people different than themselves and expose them to career pathways they might not otherwise encounter. As in my case, an “essential” job can also help people understand what they don’t want out of a career and adjust education and training accordingly. As bad as the job market currently is, it isn’t completely without opportunities. Walmart, Amazon, Ace Hardware and more have hired hundreds of thousands and are continuing to do so. A variety of retail outlets including grocery stores, online shopping services, delivery companies and pharmacies are also hiring. These are some of the “essential” jobs of the moment, and people to fill them are badly needed. High school and college graduates may also want to consider community service opportunities during their “essential job year.” Fordham University Professor Leonard Cassuto has argued that the pandemic presents a unique chance for students to make a real difference in their communities. Cassuto says that in light of the pandemic, all Americans, including students, are more aware of our responsibility to our communities. A year spent in community service can help narrow social divides and promote civic engagement. Habitat for Humanity has a gap program this year as does Service Year, which is promoting opportunities in the nation’s response to COVID-19 and in disaster relief and health care. In addition, some states and localities are hiring for short-term jobs to assist with COVID-19 testing and contact tracing. The trick for young people is to slough off the disappointment of dashed hopes and expectations and rethink how to put this time to use. Here’s the bottom line: for decades we have thought about education and employment mainly in terms of our own interests and desire for self-fulfillment. The wrenching changes wrought by COVID-19 and the delays the disease is imposing on all our lives don't have to be thought of as a waste. Work — paid or volunteer — creates an outlet for energy and an opportunity for our graduates to learn about themselves and others while providing essential services to their communities.

50,50,"Arizona's COVID-19 spread is 'alarming' and action is needed, experts warnRachel Leingang ","Jun. 10, 2020",https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/06/10/arizona-coronavirus-cases-hospitalizations-increase-after-reopening/5332572002/,"PHOENIX – Experts around the country and in Arizona are raising alarms about the state's COVID-19 situation because cases and hospitalizations have increased for the past two weeks. The increase in cases can't solely be attributed to increased testing in Arizona, experts say. Instead, it looks like the state is trending upward in a way that is concerning and could need another stay-at-home order to curb the spread. ""I would go so far as to say alarming,"" said Dr. William Hanage, an epidemiology professor at Harvard University's T.H. Chan School of Public Health. ""The only sort of crumb of comfort that I can find is that I think, in general, it's sort of easier to social distance in Arizona than it is in some places."" U.S. coronavirus map:Keep track of the numbers across the country and in your state Arizona's largest hospital system warned over the past week that its intensive care units are filling up, ventilator use was on the rise and capacity was reached for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation treatment. ""We have seen a steady climb of COVID-19 cases in Arizona over the last two weeks,"" Banner Health tweeted Monday. ""This trend is concerning to us, and also correlates with a rise in cases that we are seeing in our hospital ICUs."" The state health director sent a letter on June 6 to hospitals urging them to ""fully activate"" their emergency plans. But Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey and Dr. Cara Christ, the director of the Arizona Department of Health Services, said last week that the rise in cases was expected as Arizona started reopening. Ducey's office has repeatedly pointed to an increase in testing as the cause of case numbers increasing. Jessica Rigler, the state health department's assistant director, said the department is trying to spread the message that people can take precautions such as wearing a mask in public and staying home while sick. ""We don't want people to be in crisis mode, thinking that everything is all bad in Arizona with the cases,"" Rigler said. ""We are certainly monitoring what's going on and trying to ensure that people understand where we are with COVID-19 in our communities."" Dr. Kacey Ernst, an infectious disease epidemiologist at the University of Arizona, said all signs seem to point to the increasing transmission of the disease. Increased testing could explain increased cases, but not increased hospitalizations, she said. Arizona does appear to be increasing more than other states, she said. The situation is “very concerning,” she said. “If we continue on this trajectory and it is not just due to one or two localized outbreaks, then we may need to gear up for increasing action,” Ernst said in an email. “The director of ADHS has declared all hospitals should activate their emergency plans. That should tell us all something.” Ducey spokesman Patrick Ptak said the governor’s office is working with public health officials and community leaders to provide more guidance on reopening, “ensuring businesses return smarter and work to mitigate the spread.” Ptak said in an email that the increase in cases was anticipated, and the state is working on ways to increase hospital capacity. The old St. Luke’s hospital is “ready for activation” though not yet needed, he said. Ptak also pointed to increased testing as a reason cases are increasing, saying testing has doubled since the stay at home order ended May 15. Across the country, health experts have taken notice of Arizona's trajectory. ""There are 3 state warnings worth issuing today for COVID,"" Andy Slavitt, a former administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services under President Barack Obama, tweeted Tuesday. ""Not panic, but time to consider actions."" Arizona was on the list, along with Arkansas and Utah. Youyang Gu, a data scientist who created covid19-projections.com, posted a map of how states' cases are changing, considering both population and the rate of increase, he wrote on Twitter. In that map, Arizona appears bright red, earning the worst score for COVID-19 case changes. Positive scores on the map mean cases are decreasing. States that had early outbreaks, including New York and Michigan, now have positive scores on the map. Arizona scored -100, the lowest in the country. Other models projecting the spread of COVID-19 have adjusted their estimates upward for Arizona. A model from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington showed in mid-May that Arizona would reach about 2,900 deaths from the disease by August 4. It now predicts more than 4,400 by that date. During New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo's COVID-19 briefing June 8, he said Arizona and a few other states offered a ""cautionary tale."" With an increase like Arizona is seeing, the state needs to be thinking about how to slow the disease down, Hanage said. Reopening does the opposite because transmission occurs when people come into contact with others, he said. If states wait too long to act, they're ""sitting on a kind of powder keg of transmission chains,"" Hanage said. Let them out:Advocates want inmates granted parole freed as COVID-19 stalks prisons What is plasma therapy, and how does it work to treat the coronavirus? Everything you need to know Most indicators in Arizona show an increase in the disease's spread that goes beyond just increased testing, experts say. For example, since the day after the stay-at-home order expired May 16 to Tuesday, cases increased by 108% while testing increased by 100%. Last week, several days saw more than 1,000 newly reported cases. Prior to the past week's dramatic case increases, new cases reported daily have typically been several hundreds daily. Hospitalizations have steadily risen. Statewide hospitalizations as of Sunday were at 1,266 inpatients in Arizona with suspected and confirmed COVID-19, which was the second-highest number, behind Friday, since the state began reporting the data on April 9. The past eight days have seen inpatient hospitalizations statewide for suspected and confirmed COVID-19 eclipse 1,000. The percentage of positive tests per week increased from 5% a month ago to 6% three weeks ago to 9% two weeks ago, and 12% last week. With increasing testing, the percent of positive tests out of all tests would ideally decrease, Hanage said. Who is being tested, particularly if there are efforts to test those in congregate settings such as nursing homes, can affect this percentage, Hanage said. Can vitamin D help with symptoms of COVID-19? Possibly, it's key to helping your immune system function Statewide, Arizona didn't see a decrease in COVID-19 at any point, said Dr. Joe Gerald, an associate professor at UA's Mel & Enid Zuckerman College of Public Health. Some places did begin to plateau or level off, he said. But since social distancing restrictions were lifted in early- to mid-May, the disease has taken off, he said. ""When you put these pieces together, they're really worrisome signs that the outbreak has really gained speed and momentum again,"" Gerald said. ""And if we don't do something to turn it around fairly quickly, we could be in real trouble come early July."" Gerald said it looks like, if trends continue, hospital capacity could reach its limit by early July, which could mean trouble for providing high-quality care to people who need it. It's clear now to experts that the state is in a concerning position. But acting immediately to take measures to curb the spread won't have an immediate effect on case increases because people are already infected and spreading it to their close contacts, they said. Hanage said if he were advising the governor, he would say the least that can be done is to halt reopening and see if the increase continues. ""Even if you were to be able to take pretty effective measures now, you'd still be having a month or so of difficulty with cases at least this level, if not somewhat more,"" Hanage said. Still, experts say the state needs to act quickly to get the situation under control. The public needs to continue following public health recommendations, such as physically distancing, wearing masks and washing hands, Ernst, of the University of Arizona, said. It's also important for state leaders to follow these guidelines, she said. Ducey, for instance, has not worn a mask in public and has been pictured at meetings indoors with groups of unmasked people. ""There needs to be a cultural shift,"" Ernst said. ""So many people still aren’t wearing masks. But people see leaders not taking these precautions and they hear the state is open and they let their guard down. Psychologically, it is hard to keep it going, but it is critical. This will get closer to home to people as more get sick."" Gerald said it's hard to see how the state could avoid another shutdown at the rate cases and hospitalizations are increasing right now. Will Humble, the executive director of the Arizona Public Health Association, detailed in a blog post several steps the state should take now to stem cases. Those include focusing on testing and infection control in nursing homes, enhancing contact tracing, allowing cities to put their own mitigation strategies in place and requiring people to wear cloth masks in public. Those steps could make it so the state doesn't have to institute another stay at home order, Humble said. ""If we don't do anything, we're just going to drive off a cliff,"" Humble said.

51,51,"Purdue president Mitch Daniels: If athletic team had COVID-19 outbreak, school would 'shut it down'Steve Berkowitz ","Jun. 4, 2020",https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/college/2020/06/04/purdue-president-if-team-covid-19-outbreak-would-shut-down/3145710001/,"Purdue University president Mitch Daniels told a U.S. Senate committee on Thursday that if one of the athletic teams at his school experiences an outbreak of COVID-19, that team would need to stop all activity, at least temporarily. Daniels made the comments in response to specific questioning during a hearing of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee that was titled: “COVID-19: Going Back to College Safely” and held through video conferencing. Daniels addressed the issue under questioning from Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), who has been a critic of the NCAA on a range of athlete-welfare issues.  Murphy asked: “What happens if you have an outbreak over the course of summer training or in the early fall on the football team or on your women's soccer team? What's your protocol? Do you shut that team down? Do they stop playing the season? Do you just segment off the players who have tested positive? This is a potential for a super-spreading environment if you're not careful.” Murphy did not say what would constitute an “outbreak,” and Daniels did not offer a definition in his response, which was: “I completely agree with you. I think you would shut it down. And I think that somewhere out there, someone may very well face this situation. … We love sports, too. But first things first. ""And that starts with the safety of people -- players, coaches. Don't forget that the people who may be at most risk of a spread here are the older folks, coaches and others. So I hope we get back. But if it takes longer or if it is subject to interruption, then so be it,"" Daniels said. In response to a request from USA TODAY Sports for more specifics from Daniels about what would constitute an outbreak on a team, school spokesman Tim Doty provided a statement that read: ""Like other universities, we do not yet have firm answers about the return of college athletics and the scenarios that may impede competition. What we do know is that we will prioritize safety and will follow the guidance of the Big Ten, NCAA and our medical advisory team to do our part to protect student-athletes, coaches, employees and fans."" Daniels also told the Senate panel that Purdue currently plans to play home football games with crowds limited to no more than one-fourth of Ross-Ade Stadium’s usual seating capacity of just over 57,000, saying, ""This has been mapped out just as we have mapped out classrooms and dorm rooms to measure distance and then exceed the requirements."" In addition, Daniels questioned whether fans will be able to attend games played indoors. “Now we know that outdoors is very different -- that it's very hard to spread this outdoors,"" he said. ""But we're still going to take an abundance-of-caution approach. I cannot tell you about indoor sports right now. I don't think I see a way that we can proceed on anything like the basis that we've all been familiar with.” This comes as some major-college sports programs this week resumed voluntary on-campus workouts that had been suspended due to the coronavirus pandemic. Initial testing of athletes and staff at Mississippi, Oklahoma State, Iowa State and Marshall have produced a small number of positive tests, those schools have announced. The schools have said those who tested positive have been quarantined and that contact tracing has been initiated."

The World Health Organization walked back on coronavirus transmission comments. And something – somewhere – is sending Earth unexplained signals from across the universe.

George Floyd's 6-year-old daughter Gianna misses the bear hugs that only Floyd could give, the joy of riding on his shoulders, the countless hours they spent playing games. Gianna recently told former Vice President Joe Biden the many things she missed about her dad, who recounted the wrenching conversation in a video message delivered during Tuesday's funeral for the man who died in police custody last month. She also asked Biden why Floyd had to die. ""No child should have to ask questions that too many black children have asked for generations: Why?"" Biden said. ""Now is the time for racial justice. That’s the answer we must give to our children when they ask why."" Relatives and elected leaders spoke passionately at Floyd's funeral, demanding reforms and justice for a black man whose death has shaken the world. Remember when the World Health Organization suggested COVID-19 transmission by asymptomatic individuals is ""very” rare? They’re taking that back. An official leading WHO's coronavirus response clarified comments made at a media briefing on Monday, saying the remarks were referring to a small subset of studies and unpublished information from member states. “I used the phrase ‘very rare,’ and I think that’s a misunderstanding to state that asymptomatic transmission globally is very rare,” said Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove, WHO’s technical lead. In contact tracing efforts from other countries, secondary transmission from asymptomatic individuals was rarely found, she said, but the subject is still “a major unknown.” There’s nothing this astronaut can’t do. Convince me otherwise, I dare you. The first American woman to walk in space just added another first to her list of badass accomplishments: She is now also the first woman to reach the deepest point in the ocean. Former NASA astronaut Kathryn D. Sullivan, an oceanographer and veteran of three space shuttle flights, is the first person to achieve both feats. What did Sullivan do to celebrate her nearly 7-mile dive to Challenger Deep in the Mariana Trench? She called her astronaut buddies at the International Space Station, obviously. Only eight people have reached the bottom of Challenger Deep.  A 2.7 magnitude earthquake rattled portions of northern California on Tuesday, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. The quake, centered near the campus of the University of California, Berkeley, occurred along the Hayward Fault.

Your eyes, nose and mouth must be visible for Face ID, Apple’s facial recognition software, to recognize you. But with the coronavirus, device owners may be wearing masks when out in public. So Apple is making it easier for you to unlock your phone when you have a mask on. Install the update and you will no longer have to wait for Face ID to fail several times before being prompted to enter your passcode. After Face ID fails for the first time, you can swipe up from the bottom of the screen and enter your passcode to unlock your phone or approve an Apple Pay transaction. Or, as soon as you lift up your phone, you can swipe up from the bottom of your iPhone screen right away.  Apple is reopening some stores this week:Expect to wear a mask, have temperature checked Apple, Google roll out contact tracing:The technology will be used in public health mobile apps Does your phone know you? How your Samsung Galaxy responds to you in a face mask If Face ID is still too annoying, you can turn it off altogether.  To do that, open the Settings app on your iPhone. Scroll down and tap Face ID & Passcode. Enter your passcode and turn off iPhone Unlock. You can also disable Face ID for specific tasks such as approving Apple Pay transactions. If you turn off Face ID for Apple Pay, you will have to enter your passcode to make purchases. Wearing a face mask is required to enter businesses or to be out in public in some places. The Centers for Disease Control says masks can help prevent the spread of the coronavirus. Wednesday’s iOS update also includes the new contact tracing technology Apple has released to help public health officials develop mobile apps to identify and test people who’ve spent time with or near someone infected with the coronavirus."

""This will give Googlers who need to come back to the office – or, capacity permitting, who want to come back – the opportunity to return on a limited, rotating basis (think: one day every couple of weeks, so roughly 10 percent building occupancy),"" wrote Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai in a Tuesday blog post. Alphabet is the parent company of Google.  ""We’ll have rigorous health and safety measures in place to ensure social distancing and sanitization guidelines are followed, so the office will look and feel different than when you left.

Both Facebook and Twitter recently said they expect employees to be able to work from home for the near future.  Google and Facebook, most notably, have built giant campuses in the San Francisco Bay Area with free perks like gyms, outdoor volleyball courts, free meals and massages in a bid to keep employees on campus for as many hours as possible.  Leaders have said that having workers together on campus leads to better collaboration, but in the wake of the coronavirus crisis, workers were sent home, and spending more time communicating with one another via video conferencing tools like Google Meet, Webex, Zoom and Microsoft Teams.  Moving to September, Pichai said he will bring in more Googlers, to allow 30% capacity in buildings. That means that most people who want to come in ""could do so on a limited basis, while still prioritizing those who need to come in.""  Currently, Google employees are working at home, and Pichai said only a ""limited"" number of Googlers are physically needed in the office this calendar year. ""For everyone else, returning to the office will be voluntary through the end of the year, and we encourage you to continue to work from home if you can."" Many employees have requested to work at home permanently, and Pichai said Google is weighing how to keep the in-person collaboration and community with the online work experience.  ""We continue to study all the data and feedback you’re sharing on your current experience,"" Pichai said. ""I believe that ultimately these insights will lead to more flexibility and choice for employees as they consider how to work in the future.""

56,56,"Fact check: No, the same doctor did not autopsy JFK, MLK, Jeffrey Epstein and George FloydDevon Link ","Jun. 11, 2020",https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2020/06/11/fact-check-doctor-didnt-autopsy-jfk-mlk-epstein-and-george-floyd/5329657002/,"A viral claim misrepresenting a connection among several high-profile autopsies is igniting online speculation. “Autopsy doc for George Floyd was doc who did autopsies for MLK, JFK, Jeffrey Epstein,” said a tweet posted on Instagram on June 7 by QTheWakeUp. While some commenters expressed disbelief that one person performed the four autopsies across a 57-year span, others suspected something sinister. “Well trusted to keep the secrets. Can’t trust just anybody,” abstractagim commented. The screenshotted tweet came from Mike Bravo, a self-described freelance reporter known for pushing QAnon conspiracies on his account.  In his tweet, Bravo included a link to pathologist Michael Baden’s Wikipedia page.  ""Sometimes I dabble in conspiracies, but that's because they are fun, and I enjoy the research,"" Bravo told USA TODAY. Bravo correctly identifies Baden as having some involvement in all four cases. However, he misrepresents the pathologist's role to imply a deeper connection. Baden has served as an expert in many investigations, including: Medgar Evers, Martin Luther King Jr., President John F. Kennedy, John Belushi, Jeffrey Epstein, Kobe Bryant and George Floyd. After Baden testified for the defense in the O.J. Simpson trial in 1995, he was deemed the “celebrity pathologist.” Baden is a Fox News contributor and hosted HBO’s show ""Autopsy.""  He served as New York City's chief medical examiner and chairman of the Forensic Pathology Panel for the House Select Committee on Assassinations.  In 2014, Baden conducted Michael Brown's second autopsy and reviewed Eric Garner's autopsy results at the request of their families. Baden did not return USA TODAY's request for comment. A day after Floyd died, pinned by the neck under police officer Derek Chauvin's knee for nearly nine minutes, Hennepin County Medical Examiner's Office pathologist Andrew Baker performed Floyd's autopsy May 26.  The autopsy found ""no physical findings that support a diagnosis of traumatic asphyxia or strangulation"" and suggested underlying health conditions or potential intoxicants contributed to Floyd’s death. Floyd’s family commissioned Baden and Dr. Allecia Wilson to perform a second autopsy. The second autopsy found Floyd died from “asphyxia due to neck and back pressure.” Baden and Wilson said the neck pressure fatally “interfered with his breathing and blood flow to the brain.” ""What we found is consistent with what people saw,"" Baden said. ""There is no other health issue that could cause or contribute to the death. Police have this false impression that if you can talk, you can breathe. That’s not true."" The Floyd family’s attorney, Ben Crump, announced the preliminary findings from Baden and Wilson’s autopsy in a tweet June 1. Hours after Kennedy was assassinated Nov. 22, 1963, three military pathologists performed his autopsy: Navy Cmdr. James Humes, Navy Cmdr. J. Thornton Boswell and Army Lt. Col. Pierre Finck. In 1976, Congress established the House Select Committee on Assassinations to review the deaths of JFK and MLK. The committee considered scientific evidence, government files and witness testimony. As chairman of the Forensic Pathology Panel, Baden testified before the committee in the 1970s. During his testimony, Baden confirmed he had no contact with the Kennedy case before reviewing archival materials with the panel. After King was shot April 4, 1968, Shelby County, Tennessee, medical examiner  Jerry Francisco performed his autopsy.  To address criticism around the thoroughness of the report, the House committee had a panel of three pathologists review the archival medical evidence in the 1970s. Baden served as spokesman for that panel and concluded the findings were generally accurate.  Baden testified that Francisco didn’t dissect the path of the bullet during the autopsy because of his ""concerns about not causing any unnecessary deformity to the body"" and ""his sensitivity to the treatment of the dead."" He said, ""Tracing the bullet track proper at the time of the autopsy would have given additional information for questions that might arise later."" Epstein, a well-connected philanthropist, wealthy financier and registered sex offender, was found dead as he awaited sex trafficking charges in August 2019. Epstein’s connections to Presidents Bill Clinton and Donald Trump, as well as Britain's Prince Andrew, caused some people to suspect foul play in his death. New York City’s chief medical examiner, Barbara Sampson, handled Epstein's autopsy and ruled his death a suicide. Evidence of neck injuries – along with the dirt many anticipated Epstein might share during his trial – inspired many conspiracy theories surrounding his death. Epstein’s brother hired Baden to explore those suspicions. Sampson allowed Baden to observe Epstein’s autopsy. “This is routine practice,” she told FactCheck.org in August. After the autopsy, Baden expressed his disagreement with the findings in several interviews. ""There were findings that are unusual for suicide by hanging and consistent with ligature homicidal strangulation,"" Baden said on Fox & Friends in October. Despite Baden’s suspicions, Sampson held that a second autopsy was not necessary. “Our investigation concluded that the cause of Mr. Epstein’s death was hanging and the manner of death was suicide,"" she said. ""The original medical investigation was thorough and complete. There is no reason for a second medical investigation by our office.” We rate the claim that the same doctor autopsied the bodies of JFK, MLK, Epstein and Floyd FALSE because it is not supported by our research. Baden has ties to all four investigations, but he performed an autopsy only on Floyd. He reviewed archival evidence for JFK and MLK's cases and consulted for Epstein's.

The credit can now be redeemed without calling the company, according to Ludlow, and  is valid  through December 2021.  ""We want to apologize once again to those guests who wait for refunds, particularly at a time of financial constraints; however, the new technology we have in place is rapidly improving things, though, and we continue to make further progress on a daily basis,"" Ludlow added. Princess Cruises offers a similar credit.  Cruise lines slow to issue refunds:Coronavirus 'dwarfs any disruption we've experienced' While Canada's ban on cruises has been pushed into the fall, the CDC's  no-sail order is set to expire on July 24, and major cruise companies, including Norwegian, Royal Caribbean, Carnival and Disney, have extended their sailing suspensions just past that date. But how can passengers feel safe going forward, once ships resume sailing? One way to do so is by detailing cleanliness measure updates. Norwegian Cruise Line launched a new health initiative, Peace of Mind, to clue cruisers in on how it will combat the spread of COVID-19 when sailings resume. Sailings are currently canceled through July 31.   Guests and crew members will face an enhanced pre-embarkation health screening, in addition to temperature checks and monitoring during the trip. Such checks will occur before meals in dining venues and activities in public venues. Other measures include social distancing, with the implementation of staggered embarkation and advanced online check-in. Onboard activities may see reduced capacity or be modified to adhere to appropriate distancing.  Guests can also expect a new air filtration system and the inclusion of testing kits and more medical supplies on board, including more medications to treat symptoms of COVID-19. Several  companies are moving ahead with technology that could be implemented on ships so that cruisers can return to sea with less worry – though most cruise lines haven't announced specific plans. Infrared Cameras announced  a partnership with Carnival Cruise Line to screen passenger and crew member temperatures via thermal camera systems. USA TODAY has reached out to Carnival for more information.

58,58,Coronavirus vaccine not the end-all-be-all. We must have a plan for reopening without one.Dr. Joel M. Zinberg ,"Jun. 3, 2020",https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2020/06/03/coronavirus-vaccine-not-end-all-must-plan-reopening-without-column/5265918002/,"Dr. Anthony Fauci and other experts have touted vaccines as the ultimate solution to dealing with the threat of COVID-19.  There are strong reasons to doubt this. The eight vaccine candidates Dr. Fauci described to the Senate  face daunting obstacles on the road from laboratory to final Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval and mass manufacturing. If one or two vaccines do make it through, it will be a year or more before they are widely available. Even then, the vaccines may not be effective enough or sufficiently utilized to defeat the new illness. The approval process for vaccines follows the same general FDA pathway as for drugs, including pre-clinical discovery and development and three phases of clinical trials in humans. The process can take over 10 years and cost billions of dollars with less than one in ten candidates making it to market, although vaccines for acute infectious diseases and prophylaxis often do better. The speed of pre-clinical development for COVID-19 vaccines has been unprecedented — Moderna’s innovative m-RNA platform moved from receiving the coronavirus genome to having a testable vaccine in 44 days. But as Dr. Fauci emphasized, even if everything goes perfectly during clinical trials, there are another 6-12 months to go until approval, and additional time will be needed to ramp up production. Approval is just the first hurdle. No vaccine is 100% effective at reducing the risk of becoming ill. Effectiveness rates often vary by age group, particularly for the elderly who are most vulnerable to COVID-19 and may not mount as good an immune response to make antibodies as younger people. Over the past 15 years, vaccine effectiveness for another familiar respiratory illness — seasonal influenza — has ranged between 10 and 60%. The vaccine that was specifically created for the 2009 influenza pandemic was 62% effective for people under 65 and 43% effective for people 65 and older. And regardless of how effective a vaccine is, it can only work if people get vaccinated. In recent seasonal influenza seasons, only 45% of the U.S. population was vaccinated. Only 27% of Americans were was vaccinated during the 2009 influenza pandemic even though that virus was new and different from the seasonal virus and posed a larger potential threat. Testing and production take time:Don't count on getting a coronavirus vaccine in 2021 People cite two primary categories of reasons they forego the influenza vaccine: safety concerns (36% worry about side effects; 31% believe the vaccine causes the flu); and doubts about the effectiveness and need for vaccination (31% believe vaccines don’t work very well; 30% say they never get the flu; and 27% believe they won't get seriously sick from the flu. Undoubtedly, more people will accept a COVID-19 vaccine — doubters of the seriousness of influenza would probably not share the same feelings about COVID-19. In addition, there is high “prevalence-elasticity” of demand for vaccines for acute infectious diseases — as the prevalence of illness rises in a pandemic, the demand for a vaccine will also increase. If demonstrating immunity acquired from exposure or vaccination became a prerequisite for participation in large social and sporting events, people might be nudged toward vaccination. Nevertheless, it remains likely that many people will not be vaccinated. While COVID-19 is currently in the news, by the time a vaccine is finally approved, the disease may be less prevalent than now, resulting in decreased demand. And in a recent Reuters poll where most people said they would be vaccinated, 38% said they would wait until a vaccine had already been taken by much of the public and proven safe. Coronavirus question:Let's say a vaccine proves safe and effective. Then what? Continuing the economically devastating lockdown another 6-12 months while we bet on the likelihood that a vaccine will be approved, that it will be highly effective and that people will use it, is a risky and unnecessary wager. As I have outlined elsewhere, we know that risk of hospitalization and death from COVID-19 is concentrated in the elderly and people with underlying medical problems, and it is largely a mild, even asymptomatic disease for the young.  Rather than waiting for a vaccine, we should continue mitigation measures that insulate the most vulnerable while we safely open the economy with continued precautions like decreased capacity and social distancing in public venues, screening and contact tracing for workers and mask use for adults when distancing is not possible.

59,59,Montana gates to Yellowstone park will open Monday after coronavirus close,"May 29, 2020",https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/news/2020/05/29/montana-gates-yellowstone-park-opening-monday/5281796002/,"Montana's three entrances to Yellowstone National Park will reopen to visitors Monday, as the state moves to its second phase of restarting the economy after shutdowns because of the coronavirus. Parts of Glacier National Park could open in mid-June, Gov. Steve Bullock added Thursday, but a specific day has not been set. The West Yellowstone, Gardiner and Cooke City entrances to Yellowstone will open two weeks after Wyoming's entrances near Cody and Jackson. The park, famous for its geysers and bison, remains open for day use only. No overnight accommodations are available, and large tour buses aren't allowed yet, park Superintendent Cam Sholly said. Park employees won't be policing visitors' compliance with U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines such as social distancing and wearing masks, Sholly said Thursday. “We have to have the respect of the public to adhere to health guidelines,” he said. The opening of Yellowstone remains a gradual one. Limited overnight facilities, such as cabins and campgrounds, will begin reopening later in June, Sholly said. The Montana gates will reopen at 10 a.m. Monday. Montana's second phase of reopening Monday includes allowing bars and restaurants to operate at 75% of capacity and letting groups of up to 50 gather as long as they can meet social distancing guidelines. Montana is also lifting its 14-day quarantine for out-of-state visitors. The elderly and people with underlying medical conditions are encouraged to stay home. Companies are encouraged to continue having employees work at home, if possible. With the increase in visitors, Montana is going to increase COVID-19 testing in destination and gateway areas and of park employees and other workers in tourist areas, Bullock said. Additional contact tracing will be available, too. Montana is using $20 million of its federal coronavirus relief money to offer grants of up to $5,000 for businesses to help pay for masks, gloves, cleaning supplies and plastic shields to keep employees and customers safe, Bullock said. The state is also spending $15 million to help destination areas develop and deliver an informational campaign to remind visitors of the state's coronavirus guidelines. Bullock is asking visitors to respect those guidelines as well as those set by individual businesses and to exercise patience as Montana communities “slowly and gradually welcome you back.” The eastern entrances to Glacier National Park, which lead to the Blackfeet Indian Reservation, are expected to remain closed until the Blackfeet Tribal Council lifts its prohibition on nonessential travel, Bullock said.

60,60,"Big Apple back in business, churches reopen, vaccine poll: News from around our 50 statesFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports ","Jun. 9, 2020",https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/06/09/big-apple-back-business-churches-reopen-vaccine-poll-news-around-states/111933278/,"Montgomery:Multiple men incarcerated at the Federal Prison Camp have signed their names to a lawsuit against the Bureau of Prisons, asking a federal judge to order officials to begin processing inmates to home confinement, compassionate release or to another prison to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus. The Federal Prison Camp has not reported outbreak levels of infection. In fact, only two active cases were reported among staff and none in the inmate population as of Friday. But in court filings in recent weeks, multiple men said lax protective measures and continued movement in and out of the prison by guards and inmates who work on Maxwell Air Force Base is putting the prison population at increased risk. Nearly 80 federal prisoners across the country have died from COVID-19 complications, according to the most recent data release by the Bureau of Prisons, and the pandemic has prompted multiple lawsuits from prisoners and their supporters. On Thursday, the U.S. Supreme Court blocked a federal judge’s order to begin removing 800 inmates in an Ohio prison, according to a NBC News report. The Supreme Court order will allow the federal government additional time to challenge the federal order. The American Civil Liberties Union said nine prisoners have died and at least 20% of the population has been infected by the coronavirus at Elkton Federal Correctional Institution in LIsbon, Ohio. Anchorage: A crew member of a state ferry in the Aleutian Islands tested positive for COVID-19 and sailings were canceled until further notice, officials said. The Alaska Department of Transportation said a crew member of the M/V Tustumena tested positive after displaying symptoms Saturday, KTUU-TV reported. The crew member, who was not identified, had a runny nose, cough and body aches but did not have a fever. The crew member was isolated from other staff and passengers before being tested. The ferry had 35 crew members and no more than 60 passengers traveling from Homer to Dutch Harbor in Unalaska. Officials determined 16 people working as crew members on the vessel came in close contact with the infected person. The Alaska Division of Public Health is working to identify everyone who might be affected, officials said. The Tustumena arrived in Dutch Harbor on Saturday after returning to service June 2. Phoenix:Hospitalizations in Arizona of patients with suspected and confirmed COVID-19 have hit a record and the state’s largest health system has reached capacity for patients needing external lung machines. Arizona’s total identified cases rose to 26,889 on Sunday. Health officials had reported 1,578 new cases on Friday – by far the highest daily count since the outbreak began in March – 1,119 more cases Saturday and 1,044 on Sunday. .Also, ventilator and ICU bed use by patients with suspected and confirmed COVID-19 in Arizona hit record highs on Friday, the latest numbers showed. Statewide hospitalizations as of Friday jumped to 1,278 in Arizona with suspected and confirmed COVID-19, which was a record since the state began reporting the data on April 9. It was the fifth consecutive day that hospitalizations statewide have eclipsed 1,000. On Saturday morning, officials with Banner Health notified the Arizona centralized COVID-19 surge line that Banner hospitals are unable to take any new patients needing extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. ECMO is an an external lung machine that’s used if a patient’s lungs get so damaged that they don’t work, even with the assistance of a ventilator. Mountain Home:Area churches are welcoming congregations back to worship services after being closed for more than two months amid the coronavirus pandemic. Although Gov. Asa Hutchinson announced on May 4 that the state’s churches could begin reopening for services under certain guidelines, many local churches – particularly those with large congregations – have waited. Vince Daniel, lead pastor of Real Life Church in Mountain Home, prepandemic attendance at three Sunday services at Real Life averaged between 1,100 to 1,400 people. Last Sunday, his church started holding two morning services at 9:30 a.m. and 11 a.m. Pastor Tad Rogers from First Baptist Church in Mountain Home will welcome his congregation back Sunday with services at 9 a.m. and 11 a.m. Local churches that have opened or will soon open their doors for worship include Redeemer Lutheran Church, where 100 of the church’s 500-member congregation returned to worship May 31 at one 10 a.m. service, according to Congregation Chairman Dr. Robert Nosari. On May 23, Eastside Baptist Church began holding Sunday services at 9 a.m. and 10:30 a.m. and St. Peter the Fisherman Catholic Church resumed in-person worship with services at 7 a.m., 8:30 a.m. and 11 a.m., and a Saturday service at 4 p.m. Los Angeles: A Catholic archbishop celebrated the first in-person Mass since public worship services were suspended in Los Angeles because of the coronavirus pandemic. Archbishop José H. Gomez celebrated the Mass at the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels on Sunday, The Los Angeles Times reported. The morning service was limited to 100 people, with face masks and social distancing required for all those at the downtown cathedral. People older than 65, suffering from underlying health conditions or experiencing any COVID-19 symptoms were encouraged to instead watch a livestream on Facebook. The cathedral was scheduled to be cleaned and sanitized immediately following the Mass, the Los Angeles Archdiocese said. Public religious services were suspended March 16 because of the pandemic. Mass is scheduled to be celebrated at the Catholic cathedral in English at 8 a.m. on weekdays, with no more than 100 people in attendance. Loveland:The city said Friday that it is ordering mandatory unpaid furloughs for most city employees to cut expenses because of the coronavirus pandemic’s revenue impact, according to a news release. City employees will be required to take six unpaid days off by Dec. 4.Exemptions to the furlough requirement include sworn officers of the police department below the rank of assistant chief, police dispatchers, employees operating City of Loveland Transit and employees engaged in operations not funded by the general fund. In addition to furloughs, the city also announced that is offering voluntary separation buyouts for employees to increase potential cost savings. Friday’s furlough news was Loveland’s third round of cuts since the pandemic’s effects hit Colorado in March. The city furloughed or laid off 280 temporary or seasonal employees in April and followed that up in May with furloughs for more than 40 employees in recreation, library and cultural services operations. The city’s news release said many of those 40 furloughed employees are expected to return as the Chilson Recreation Center, Loveland Museum and Loveland Public Library reopen when state and Larimer County public health orders permit. Hartford: Gov. Ned Lamont released detailed Phase 2 pandemic lockdown reopening guidelines for state businesses on Sunday, stressing social distancing, limited capacity, face mask requirements and sanitation. Before the June 17 reopening, businesses must prepare a detailed plan and employee training program and appoint staff to enforce rules. Restaurants, gyms, theaters, libraries and bowling alleys will have a maximum capacity of 50% of normal. Patrons at outdoor events will have to wear masks but performers won’t need them as long as they’re at least 12 feet from anyone. People are advised to stay home if they’re 65 or older or have health conditions making them more vulnerable to coronavirus complications. Wilmington:The lifting of Delaware’s stay-at-home order on June 1 didn’t trigger the economic reawakening for which the state had hoped, as many stores remained closed over fears of the coronavirus and weekend looting. All of the state’s malls – Christiana, Concord and Dover – remained closed after looters hit the Dover Mall on the night of May 31 at the end of a day of protests in response to George Floyd’s death. Many national chains including J.C. Penney, Marshalls and Burlington had decided to keep their Delaware stores closed June 1, while others continued operating through curbside pickup and by appointment. The decisions left only a handful of stores with crowds of those eager to return to their usual routines, after more than two months under the state’s stay-at-home order. Hundreds of stores between the Christiana, Concord and Dover malls were set to open on June 1 after store owners and mall officials spent weeks crafting new safety protocols to meet the state’s social distancing requirements and inspire confidence in shoppers. Videos showing demonstrators wading through shattered glass with products from stores including Forever 21 and Macy’s, revealed a new safety threat, mall officials said, prompting the postponement of their reopenings indefinitely. Washington:Health officials reported and additional 57 cases of the new coronavirus and two additional deaths, WUSA-TV reported. In total, the District has reported 9,389 coronavirus cases and 491 deaths. Health officials are urging those protesting the death of George Floyd to get tested for COVID-19. West Palm Beach:The infection rate for the new coronavirus is twice as rampant among blacks and Latinos in Florida than it is among white people, a Palm Beach Post analysis of internal Health Department testing data showed. About 25% of Hispanics and 20% of blacks tested positive for the virus, compared to about 11% of whites, The Post found in analyzing nearly 200,000 test results in which patients self-reported their race or ethnicity. The Post found large concentrations of the disease in ZIP codes with a majority of black or Hispanic residents and a much smaller concentration in white-majority ZIP codes, in an analysis of an even larger portion of the data, about 545,000 test results in which patients listed their home address. Additionally, more than 60% of about 43,000 people confirmed with the disease lived in ZIP codes where Census estimates showed the majority of residents are not white. An examination of negative test results showed most were from majority white ZIP codes. Savannah: After two postponements because of COVID-19, Georgia will take to the polls on Tuesday for a primary election. And the Chatham County Board of Elections is looking to make sure that voting during a pandemic is as safe as possible. In order to provide enough space for social distancing, a few polling places have been changed, and a few have been combined. Voters can find up-to-date information on their polling place at www.mvp.sos.ga.gov. In a typical election, Chatham County has 92 polling places. This time, there will be 90. Two weeks ahead of the election, the Board of Elections were down by 22 sites. Senior centers were out of the question, and a few polling places are not large enough to support the social distancing requirements. Some polling places will be cleaned after the election on the county’s dime, including all of the schools that are polling places and a few other sites who requested the cleaning. Absentee ballots can be turned in up until 7 p.m. Tuesday, after which they will be tabulated. Early voting numbers for 2020 show a total turnout of 4,054 ballots cast early as of Thursday, with 1,090 Republican ballots, 2,931 Democratic ballots and 33 nonpartisan ballots. Kailua-Kona: An ocean shipping firm requesting federal coronavirus relief funding will continue operations under a reduced schedule and move its barge service to Mondays, officials said. Young Brothers LLC will operate under the reduced schedule for the next month, West Hawaii Today reported Sunday. The Hawaii Public Utilities Commission is investigating the financial condition of the state’s only regulated interisland cargo company after it requested $25 million in federal coronavirus relief to remain in business. The 120-year-old Honolulu company is considered valuable to local economies, especially on smaller islands such as Molokai and Lanai that depend on its tug-and-barge service. The utilities commission last week approved a 30-day extension of the company’s sailing schedule effective June 12 that will include adjustments. Among the changes, Young Brothers plans to move the barge arrival day in Hilo on the Big Island from Thursday to Monday. The adjustment is expected to help farmers and other producers who have had difficulty getting perishables to market in time for the weekend. Boise: State residents on unemployment could receive a one-time bonus of up to $1,500 to return to work under a plan Gov. Brad Little announced Friday. The Republican governor said the incentive is intended to help get the state’s economy going again following the coronavirus pandemic. Part-time workers would receive $750. “Now is the time for us to provide Idahoans with the financial incentive to return to work and ensure our economic rebound is swift and robust,” Little said. The state’s unemployment rate has rocketed to 11.5% with more than 100,000 unemployed. But Idaho is in the third stage of Little’s four-stage plan to reopen during the pandemic, and there are signs the economy is turning around. Nearly all businesses can now open under the guidelines. Little said he’s concerned that enhanced unemployment benefits could add up to more than a potential worker could make going back to work. Through May 30, Idaho residents have received about $312 million in unemployment insurance benefits through federal and state programs. Little said the incentive bonus payments made on a first-come, first-served basis could help persuade workers to return to the job. The money for the payments is coming from $100 million of the $1.25 billion Idaho received in federal rescue money. Chicago: Navy Pier plans to begin reopening Wednesday, nearly three months after closing as part of state and city efforts to limit the spread of the new coronavirus. Initial reopening plans include outdoor restaurant spaces, tour boats, parking garages and outdoor parks and piers. Navy Pier officials said carnival rides including its Ferris wheel and indoor spaces including the Chicago Children’s Museum will not reopen yet. Fireworks shows also remain shut down. Staff who work directly with visitors will be required to wear face coverings and Navy Pier has assigned other staff to act as “social distancing ambassadors” to remind people to keep space between groups. “Our goal is to provide guests with a safe space to reconnect with Chicago through our free public programs, on-site local dining, retail and attractions, and our beloved vistas and vast greenspace,” President and CEO Marilynn Gardner said. “We believe we have outlined a framework that will allow us to serve as a resource for the community while protecting our guests’ well-being.” Indianapolis:The city has received $168 million in federal funding to help its government and residents cope through the financial fallout of the coronavirus pandemic – a chunk of money that city officials said is still not enough to cover the costs of the crisis. The funding will boost a variety of social services and public health needs, including $20–million for contact testing and tracing of the virus and $15 million in rental assistance. It’s part of the $150 billion Coronavirus Relief Fund distributed to states and cities of more than 500,000 people through the federal coronavirus relief package. “Now I’ll admit that that sounds like a lot of money — and it is,” Mayor Joe Hogsett said in a press conference Monday. “But when you consider the scope and the scale of what our city continues to confront as the result of the COVID-19 outbreak, it is clear that these dollars will be helpful but not sufficient.” The City-County Council was scheduled to vote on spending the first $76 million of that funding on Monday night, in addition to approving millions in Federal Emergency Management Agency funding. The relief funding will assist the city as it copes with the ongoing and unknown total impact of the pandemic, which has left millions of Americans unemployed. Residents who have experienced job loss, a reduction in work hours or increased expenses because of the pandemic will be eligible to apply for rental assistance through an application process the city will launch later this month. That money can cover previous rent due back to April 1 or future rent for up to 90 days. Another $3 million will cover meal deliveries and support three major food agencies – Gleaners Food Bank, Midwest Food Bank and Second Helpings – that have distributed food throughout the pandemic. Coralville: Leaders behind the city’s Xtream Arena and GreenState Family Fieldhouse said the $71.3 million complex that will feature a 6,000-seat arena and mixed-use/museum building, is on track for completion despite the coronavirus pandemic. Jason McKane, senior construction manager with Mortenson Construction, said the contractor intends to hand the building over to ArenaCo – the nonprofit community development corporation formed to own and operate the arena – at the end of August. “We’re focused on wrapping this thing up here over the summer,” McKane told the Cedar Rapids Gazette. “With everything that’s going on in the world … it’s been a fun challenge. We’re moving ahead with that same end date in mind for the ownership.” Topeka: The Lansing Correctional Facility is the largest single source of Kansas coronavirus cases, followed by the Tyson Foods meatpacking plant near Garden City, a public health document showed. The Kansas City Star, citing a list provided to it by Columbia University’s Brown Institute for Media Innovation, reported that the document contains a detailed account of every outbreak since May 19 in Kansas. At least 846 cases and six deaths through May 19 were traced to the Lansing prison. The Tyson plant near Garden City has seen 571 cases and one death according to the document. Outbreaks at three Sedgwick County churches collectively infected at least 32 people and resulted in one death. A retirees coffee group in Republic County led to six cases. A keg party in Wabaunsee County was linked to five cases. Multiple residents have died at nearly every nursing home where a COVID-19 outbreak has been identified. The list obtained by the newspaper was attached to a May 21 email from the Kansas Health Alert Network, a messaging system used by the Kansas Department of Health and Environment. Columbia University’s Brown Institute for Media Innovation provided it to the newspaper after obtaining it through a records request. Louisville:The James Graham Brown Foundation will give $1.5 million to fund randomized coronavirus testing across Jefferson County to better understand who has the virus and how many people have survived it. “This pandemic has been especially difficult because of what we don’t know about it,” Mason Rummel, president and chief executive of James Graham Brown Foundation, said during a Monday morning announcement that included foundation and University of Louisville leaders. The foundation, one of the largest in Kentucky, funds a variety of initiatives, mostly focused on enhancing education and workforce development, economic prosperity and quality-of-life improvements. The latest push for randomized testing is part of a broader effort by U of L, the city’s three large health systems and a group of health care executives called the Co-Immunity Project. The effort began about two months ago as a way for researchers and doctors on the front lines to collaborate on building an arsenal to battle COVID-19. Baton Rouge: Low-income families have another week to apply for a program to provide healthy meals for children who lost access to school meals during the coronavirus pandemic, the state education department said. Monday had been the original deadline to apply for the federally funded Pandemic Electronic Benefits Transfer program. But the department extended the time to apply until June 15. The federal program is for families of children in prekindergarten through 12th grade who usually receive free or reduced-price meals at school. Louisiana schools have been closed since March 16. Families can apply through a P-EBT portal on the Louisiana Department of Education website. Portland: Gov. Janet Mills said the state is going to quadruple its testing capacity at its lab and develop testing sites throughout the state. The office of Mills, a Democrat, said Monday that the push represented a move toward “radically expanded testing capacity.” The state is working with IDEXX Laboratories to create a new mobile lab that will be anchored at the state lab in Augusta, the office said. The state will also develop “swab and send” locations across the state to make sure 90% of residents can get tested within a half-hour of their home, Mills said. She called the increased testing “another breakthrough for Maine in the fight against COVID-19.” The expanded capacity is set to come online in July. Maine also expanded testing access last month. Salisbury:With 24 fewer hospitalized patients compared to Sunday, hospitalizations in Maryland dropped below 1,000 for the first time since April 11, according to state data. The number of intensive care beds filled by COVID-19 patients has fallen to below 400. More than 8,000 tests have been entered into the Maryland Department of Health database in the last 24 hours. Less than 450 of those test results were positive. Wicomico County has seven more cases, Worcester County has four and Somerset County has one. There have been 28 new confirmed deaths reported across the state, but no additional fatalities for the three Lower Shore counties. Boston: Versatility is the key for management at Joe Sent Me, a suburban Boston restaurant reopening for outdoor dining on Monday as the state continues to recover from the coronavirus pandemic. “We’re fired up about it. It’s about time,” co-owner Sandy McCullough said as he helped set up a tent in the Waltham pub’s parking lot, where staff was placing picnic tables that can accommodate up to six diners each. “We can put six or seven tables in the parking lot, in addition to the six or seven we can fit on our patio,” he said. “We’re calling it our ‘partio.’ ” Under Phase 2 of Gov. Charlie Baker’s economic reopening plan during the coronavirus pandemic, restaurants across Massachusetts are allowed to offer al fresco dining only. They have been limited to takeout and delivery orders since mid-March. Tables have to be placed at least 6 feet apart, dining is by reservation only, and menus must be either disposable or cleaned regularly. Joe Sent Me’s menu has been revamped to give the eatery a more “outdoors” feel, with additions like potato salad and kabobs. “It’s stuff you’d have at a barbecue in your own back yard,” McCullough said. He’s also prepared to change the menu on short notice based on the availability and price of some ingredients, he said. Massachusetts Restaurant Association President Bob Luz tells the Boston Herald that roughly 80% of restaurants in the state don’t have patios and will have to wait until Phase 3 of the governor’s reopening plan. Baker’s plan to restart the economy comes after the state Department of Public Health reported Sunday that key metrics around the outbreak are on the decline, including the seven-day weighted average of positive test rates, which dipped 5%. Detroit: Nonprofit arts and culture organizations in southeastern Michigan will share $500,000 in funding to help relieve financial pressures caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Fifty grants of $10,000 each have been awarded from the COVID-19 Arts and Creative Community Assistance Fund, according to the Community Foundation for Southeast Michigan. The funding also allows the organizations to plan for new mission-related program opportunities. More than 200 organizations submitted applications for funding of more than $2 million. The COVID-19 Arts and Creative Community Assistance Fund receives support from various foundations. “We must support our region’s arts and culture organizations,” said Mariam Noland, Community Foundation for Southeast Michigan president. “The sector is a vital resource that supports thousands of jobs, supports business, and grows our economy.” Minneapolis: Health officials said Saturday that the number of coronavirus hospitalizations fell from 478 to 473 and the number of people in intensive care units dropped from 220 to 206. Health experts said hospital counts are a key factor in tracking COVID-19. Gov. Tim Walz on Friday announced that some restrictions would be eased next week, including limited resumption of business for indoor restaurants, swimming pools, movie theaters and fitness clubs. Jackson: State-run museums will start reopening soon after being closed for several weeks because of the coronavirus pandemic. The Mississippi Agriculture and Forestry Museum in Jackson reopened Monday. The children’s barnyard has goats and lambs that were born during the shutdown, state Agriculture Commissioner Andy Gipson said Friday. The Mississippi Civil Rights Museum and the Museum of Mississippi History, which are side-by-side in downtown Jackson, reopened Sunday. The state Department of Archives and History made that announcement Thursday, also saying Sunday was the reopening date for the the Eudora Welty House & Garden and the William F. Winter Archives and History Building, which are both in Jackson, and of the Grand Village of the Natchez Indians in Natchez. Springfield:The Springfield-Greene County Health Department said Monday that the incubation period has passed for people potentially exposed to the new coronavirus at a Springfield Great Clips salon, and no clients nor additional coworkers tested positive for COVID-19. “This is exciting news about the value of masking to prevent COVID-19,” Director of Health Clay Goddard said in a release. “We are studying more closely the details of these exposures, including what types of face coverings were worn and what other precautions were taken to lead to this encouraging result. We never want an exposure like this to happen, but this situation will greatly expand our understanding of how this novel coronavirus spreads.” Goddard noted in addition to masking, Great Clips had policies in place that also likely prevented the spread of the disease,. such as distancing of salon chairs, staggering appointments and other measures that will be studied. Two stylists tested positive for the virus after working at the Great Clips at 1864 S. Glenstone Ave., potentially exposing 140 clients and six coworkers. No additional clients or coworkers tested positive. Testing was offered to all those potentially exposed and 46 people pursued testing and all came back negative. Regardless of testing, everyone potentially exposed was quarantined for the duration of their exposure period. Bozeman: The state is moving ahead with its attempt to ease crowding on one of its most popular rivers. Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks has put forward a proposal for regulating fishing outfitters and easing crowding on the Madison River, one of the top fly-fishing destinations in the world, the Bozeman Daily Chronicle reported. Its proposal would cap the number of guided trips, bar guides from some river sections on certain days and create a stamp program for anglers to begin gathering data on non-guided fishing pressure. The proposal, lined out in a 51-page environmental assessment that considers a variety of regulatory options, goes before the Montana Fish and Wildlife Commission in a virtual meeting next week. The commission will vote on putting the document out for public comment, a step that would begin a public review process that state officials hope would lead to regulations going into effect in 2021. But there are people pushing to kill the process, arguing that the coronavirus pandemic makes this the wrong time to consider regulating the river. Mac Minard, executive director of the Montana Outfitters and Guides Association, said because the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic, the commission should put the process on pause. Minard said it’s “unbelievable that we’re actually resurrecting this now.” Others don’t want to see the process tanked, but don’t like what they see in the new proposal. And some feel an urgency to keep the process moving after years of heated debates and negotiations. Pat Byorth, the commissioner representing southwestern Montana, said the work has already been delayed by a few months because of the coronavirus pandemic, and that it’s just time for it to come back up. Omaha: Two children in Nebraska have been diagnosed with a rare and serious inflammatory condition that’s linked to the new coronavirus. Last week, a 9-year-old Lexington boy was diagnosed with the condition. On Monday, the Douglas County Health Department announced that a child under 12 has been hospitalized with the condition. That news came as the one-day total of new coronavirus cases in the state dropped to below 100 for the first time since May 10. Nebraska’s online coronavirus tracking dashboard showed 91 new cases were reported Sunday, to bring the state’s total to 15,634. Officials said 188 people in Nebraska have died from COVID-19. Nearly 122,000 people in Nebraska have been tested, and hospital capacity was stable, with 45% of hospital beds, 46% of intensive care unit beds and 78% of ventilators available for use. Reno:State attorneys are stepping up their defense of Gov. Steve Sisolak’s 50-person cap on religious gatherings in a legal fight with leaders of a rural church who said it violates their constitutional right to exercise their beliefs. Attorney General Aaron Ford is urging a federal judge in Reno to deny an order sought by Calvary Chapel Dayton Valley to invalidate COVID-19 restrictions so up to 90 people can attend services at a time at the 200-capacity church southeast of Reno. A telephonic hearing is scheduled Tuesday on its new request for a temporary injunction suspending the cap after the U.S. court denied its bid last week for an emergency order striking it down as unconstitutional. Concord: The University of New Hampshire is offering advice to parents struggling with whether to send their children to summer camps during the coronavirus pandemic. Officials with the university’s recreation management, health management and other programs have compiled a tip sheet to help parents make informed decisions about overnight camps. It includes information from the American Camping Association and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, along with suggested questions parents can ask about social distancing and other issues. “A good camp will welcome these questions,” said Jayson Seaman, associate professor of recreation management and policy. “Camp directors and youth development professionals recognize that kids need camp more than ever this year. Those that have decided to open are working hard to modify their programs in response to the pandemic while still giving kids a memorable camp experience.” West Long Branch:Some Monmouth University students said their neediest classmates were being denied a share of federal funding set aside for those affected by the new coronavirus. Several students contend the university’s distribution of funding from the federal Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act is based on a formula that ignored a student’s true need and instead focused only on their financial aid status. “The university created a criteria for receiving emergency aid that completely left out students that have high financial need,” said Esosa Ruffin, a 2020 Monmouth graduate and leader of Monmouth Pell Recipients for CARES Aid formed in May to protest the aid formula. The group recently launched an online petition at Change.org that urges the university to change the funding formula and reassess its distribution. The petition had received more than 1,000 names as of Friday afternoon. Monmouth University President Patrick Leahy issued a statement late Friday stating the process had been updated to include more students. Ruffin said the petition would remain until graduate students she says are still denied funding are included. Mora: New Mexico’s cattle and sheep industries are being adversely affected as the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic is causing the wholesale prices of meat and wool to drop sharply. Although the industries are affected in different ways, cow and sheep ranchers told the Santa Fe New Mexican that their difficulties might last until next year. Ranchers said demand for beef and lamb has plummeted partly because restaurants were shut down to slow the spread of the virus. Cattle ranchers also are selling fewer calves because some large meat processing plants were idled by viral outbreaks among workers. Young calves and lambs are now stuck at feedlots beyond their prescribed time, incurring more expenses while vendors wait for meat prices to rise so they can at least break even. The price for cattle in January was $1.20 per pound. It’s now at 99 cents a pound. Live lamb prices have fallen to $1.35 a pound from $1.90 two months ago. “Anybody that is trying to market livestock at all is taking a hit,” said Caren Cowan, publisher of New Mexico Stockman and Livestock Market Digest. New York City: Scarred by the deadliest coronavirus outbreak in the nation, New York City gradually began reopening Monday in a turning point in the three-month-long crisis and an important test of the city’s discipline. With the virus in check – at least for now – stores previously deemed nonessential were cleared to reopen for delivery and curbside pickup, though customers cannot yet browse inside. Construction, manufacturing and wholesalers also were cleared to resume work. Some major store chains took it slow: Macy’s declined to give a date for starting curbside pickup at its flagship store, where smash-and-grab thieves hit amid last week’s protests over George Floyd’s death. Saks Fifth Avenue, which girded itself with razor wire last week, and Tiffany’s might launch pickup service later this week. Owners of smaller shops were eager to reopen, even if they didn’t expect much business. “We are going to be open every day for the sake of showing life,” said eyewear designer Ahlem Manai-Platt, who was reopening a lower Manhattan store. Mayor Bill de Blasio welcomed the reopenings as evidence of how “strong and resilient” New York is. But he also warned the city against letting its guard down and jeopardizing its hard-won progress against the virus: “Let’s hold onto it. Let’s build on it.” Elon: A speedway drew a crowd of more than 2,000 in defiance of the state’s coronavirus restrictions after declaring the race a “protest.” The governor’s office had warned Ace Speedway earlier this week that a crowd of more than 25 would violate the state’s Phase 2 coronavirus restrictions. But news outlets reported that more than 2,000 attended a race Saturday night. A sign from management outside the speedway read, “This Event is held in Peaceful Protest of Injustice and Inequality Everywhere.” The Alamance County Sheriff’s Office said it is “evaluating the events.” Bismarck: Health officials said Monday 19 additional people have tested positive for COVID-19 in North Dakota, bringing the state total to 2,880 cases. North Dakota has confirmed 72 deaths from complications of the coronavirus but none was reported Monday. Twenty-nine people were hospitalized Sunday, an increase of one from the day before. Health officials said 2,336 people have recovered from the coronavirus, including 29 in the past day. Columbus: Annie Glenn, whose fame as an astronaut’s wife led to a life advocating for those with speech disorders, will be remembered Saturday at a virtual memorial service. Glenn, wife of the late John Glenn, died May 19 at 100 of complications from COVID-19. She had been living in a nursing home near St. Paul, Minnesota. The Glenn College of Public Affairs at Ohio State University is holding the 11 a.m. memorial service on its website. It also will be broadcast on public television. The Glenns were married for 73 years at the time of John Glenn’s death in 2016. She was at his side throughout an extraordinary life, including being the first American to orbit the Earth. Oklahoma City:Less than half of likely Republican voters in Oklahoma would get vaccinated against COVID-19 and more than 70% of likely Democratic voters would get the vaccine if it became available, according to a new poll. Although a majority of voters in both parties surveyed wear a mask at least some of the time when they go out in public, nearly three times as many Republicans as Democrats said they rarely or never wear one. The poll was conducted June 3-4 by Amber Integrated of Oklahoma City. The results include responses from 500 likely voters, with the pool weighted by party registration and demographics. The margin of error is 4.4% at a 95% confidence level. In the largely rural 3rd congressional district, which includes much of western Oklahoma, including the area that experienced a major outbreak at a meatpacking plant, only 44% of all voters said they would get a vaccine. In the 5th congressional district, which includes most of Oklahoma County, 66% of all voters said they would get a vaccine. Statewide, 63% of black voters said they would get a vaccine, and 57% of whites, 27% of Hispanics and 88% of Asians said they would get a vaccine. Newport:More than 100 workers at Newport’s Pacific Seafood plant have been confirmed positive for COVID-19, making it the second-largest workplace outbreak in the state. Lincoln County officials announced 65 coronavirus cases early Sunday linked to the seafood operation but updated the number of confirmed positive cases to 124. Only the Oregon State Penitentiary, with 165 cases, has more, according to a weekly Oregon Health Authority report. Townsend Farms in Multnomah County is now third with 51 cases. The outbreak at the Newport plant led to a spike of new cases in the coastal community and contributed to the highest total of new cases in Oregon in a day since the beginning of the pandemic, according to the Oregon Health Authority. The investigation into the outbreak started June 2, but the initial case count was below the threshold for public disclosure, OHA officials said in a release Sunday. “State and county public health officials are working with the business to address the outbreak and protect the health of workers,” health officials said. “The risk to the general public is considered low.” Philadelphia: A dozen new coronavirus cases in the Philadelphia area have been traced to someone who attended gatherings at beach houses at the Jersey Shore, according to the health department in suburban Bucks County. The department said 11 cases reported Saturday were linked to a New Jersey resident who was at gatherings in the past two weeks. One case reported Friday also was traced to the same person. “There are likely to be additional infections among family members of the new cases,” said Dr. David Damsker, the health director in Bucks County. He did not disclose further details, including exactly where the gatherings took place. “This is exactly why we can’t let our guard down now, even if it feels `safe’ to be at the beach,” Damsker said. “One unlucky exposure can lead to a large cascade of cases down the line.” Damsker said it’s important to wear face coverings when attending small gatherings involving people who are not members of the same household. Nearly 5,000 residents of Bucks County, which is just north of Philadelphia and borders New Jersey, have tested positive for the virus. Providence: Gov. Gina Raimondo apologized for violating her own safety rules by addressing demonstrators without wearing a mask. Raimondo told the Providence Journal in a statement that things were “tense and hectic” Friday night at the State House as the number of protesters swelled to at least 10,000. She said she forgot to bring a face mask when she went outside to speak. “That was wrong. It was counter to our public health guidance, and I apologize,” she wrote. Republican state Rep. Bobby Nardolillo didn’t let the misstep go unnoticed. On Twitter, he called the Democractic governor’s behavior “reckless,” told her to “KNOCK IT OFF” and encouraged her to quarantine for 14 days. Protests have been ongoing throughout the U.S. following George Floyd’s death. Floyd, a black man, died on May 25 after a white Minneapolis police officer put his knee on Floyd’s neck while he was handcuffed on the ground until he stopped breathing. Charleston: Advocates worry that elevated family stress, increased financial burdens and extended school closures mean that many children across South Carolina remain at a high risk for abuse and neglect during the coronavirus pandemic. The full extent of how this will impact the children is still unknown, said Carole Swiecicki, executive director of Dee Norton Child Advocacy Center in Charleston. Still, research of other large-scale community level disruptions, such as natural disasters, has shown a spike in child abuse in the aftermath of those events, she said. That’s because during that time children are likely isolated from school, routines have been disrupted and their parents often have higher levels of stress. Not only that, she said, but if parents are forced to return to work while schools remain closed, they might be more likely to turn to alternative child care providers that aren’t vetted by the state’s social services agency. Sturgis: A survey by the City Council found that most locals want the 80th Annual Sturgis Motorcycle Rally postponed because of the coronavirus pandemic. The Rapid City Journal reported the city mailed 3,290 surveys to resident addresses and more than 60 percent of those responding want the rally suspended. The city was scheduled to hear a presentation from the rally officials on Monday with information gathered throughout May and June from businesses, hotels, motels, campgrounds, police and hospitals. The city has said it would make an official decision in mid-June on whether to go forward with hosting the event. Sturgis Rally and Events Director Jerry Cole said his staff and city officials have had about three to five meetings a day over the past five weeks with businesses, state and federal representatives, and others. Cole said all campgrounds will be open during the rally, which is scheduled for Aug. 7-16. Nashville:The Tennessee State Fair has been canceled for the first time in its more than 150-year history because of the coronavirus pandemic. The annual event will resume Sept. 10, 2021, organizers said. The fair is not “closing its doors or abandoning its long history and tradition,” said State Fair Manager Scott Jones in a news release. “We’re just doing what we believe is in the best interest of the health and well being of those who walk through our gates each year.” Because the fair would be operating this year in a smaller space than usual because of construction for the new MLS stadium, it would be difficult to follow health care officials’ guidance for COVID-19, Jones said. Although the fair won’t be held as usual, some pop-up events might be planned, including contests and exhibits. Livestock competitions and entertainment won’t be included this year. “We plan to do our very best to provide some agenda that will still make it entertaining and educational to attend an abbreviated production of the Fair this year,” Jones said. Dallas: Three months into the coronavirus outbreak in Texas, black lawmakers said Republican Gov. Greg Abbott and state health officials have fallen short in addressing their pleas for better racial data and efforts to decrease COVD-19’s decidedly deadly toll on black Americans. The Dallas Morning News reported Sunday that since the first positive coronavirus case in Texas in March, black legislators have asked for a task force, a more accurate count of the disease’s impact on black and brown Texans and increased testing in highly affected black and brown neighborhoods. Texas has struggled to track racial health disparities. Many of the more than 70,000 confirmed cases and 1,700 deaths on the state’s case dashboard do not have information on race and ethnicity. As of Friday, the state had still not received the race or ethnicity of 79% of the cases reported to the state and 63% of the reported deaths. “We have been asking – myself, my colleagues and people of color – have been asking the government with no answers,” state Sen. Borris Miles, a Houston Democrat, told the newspaper. “It’s like we don’t exist.” Miles said he was able to get state-provided COVID-19 testing in predominantly black and Latino neighborhoods considered hot spots in his district in mid-May. But that was more than two months after Abbott declared a state of disaster. Abbott spokesman John Wittman told the newspaper that the he state will significantly ramp up testing in black and Hispanic neighborhoods on Monday. He did not provide additional details. In April, Abbott said he was working with lawmakers to better respond to the pandemic’s disproportionate impact on African Americans. Cedar City:A proposed coronavirus “protest” concert featuring country artist Collin Raye that was twice rejected in other parts of Utah has been permitted in Iron County. Despite a recent rise in COVID-19 cases and state guidelines that recommend limiting gatherings to 50 or fewer people, event organizers said they hope to draw about 3,000 to the show, which will take place at a resort west of Cedar City. The show had initially been set to take place on May 30 in Kaysville with the support of Kaysville Mayor Katie Witt, but public outcry over the risks for further spreading the coronavirus caused the organizers to look for a new venue. Eric Moutsos, a former police officer and the concert promoter via a Facebook group called Utah Business Revival, then arranged for the event to be held at The Amphitheater at Studio Ranch in Grantsville on May 30. That proposal was met with a restraining order filed by Tooele County against Moutsos and venue owner Jason Manning. The restraining order affidavit stated that Tooele County had “no prior notice of this concert” before learning of the plan from a KSL radio show producer just nine days before the event was being advertised to take place. The concert was approved Monday by the Iron County Commissioners to take place at the Iron Springs Adventure Resort several miles west of downtown Cedar City. According to a Facebook post, the resort, owned by Frank Nicholls, has several thousand acres of trails and camping space. “We’ll have enough space so people can social distance,” Iron County Commissioner Paul Cozzens said. “We’re asking people to respect that. If people want to wear masks, that’s great.” Winooski: The outbreak of COVID-19 that began in the city on Memorial Day has grown to 62 cases, including 24 children, and spread to other communities, state officials said Monday. Health Commissioner Dr. Mark Levine said that in addition to those in Winooski, nine are from the adjoining city of Burlington and five are from other communities. There have been no reports of hospitalizations or deaths and only one in five of the infected individuals showed any symptoms, Levine said. Officials said the outbreak is confined to “one social network of families,” but they have been reluctant to provide more details, citing confidentiality concerns. Contact tracers have identified shared activities that could have led to the outbreak and officials believe there has been spread within households as well, said state Epidemiologist Patsy Kelso. “We think this is a pretty well contained situation or outbreak and while the case numbers may go up because there may have been exposures in the recent days even, we don’t think this is something that we will see pop up all over the state,” Kelso said. Richmond: Eviction proceedings in Virginia were halted Monday because of a temporary statewide moratorium, Gov. Ralph Northam said. Virginia Supreme Court Chief Justice Donald Lemons issued the order Monday, which will remain in effect through June 28. Evictions were put on hold in mid-March while courthouses were closed because of the coronavirus pandemic. But on May 17, the order to suspend nonemergency proceedings expired, allowing backlog eviction lawsuits to continue. On May 18, Lynchburg General District Court Chief Judge Sam Eggleston III heard 90 eviction lawsuits, the most of any court in Virginia, The News & Advance previously reported. The moratorium gives Northam’s administration time to implement a rent relief program for residents facing housing insecurity during the pandemic. Details regarding the rent relief initiative are expected to be announced in the upcoming weeks. Olympia: A farm workers union has sued two state agencies over rules that would allow workers to sleep in close quarters on bunk beds during the coronavirus pandemic. The lawsuit filed last week by Familias Unidas por la Justicia seeks to repeal parts of rules adopted by the Department of Labor & Industries and the Department of Health, Tri-City Herald reported Sunday. Temporary farm workers typically reside in dormitory-style housing with several hundred workers, the lawsuit said. The state’s emergency heath rules that took effect May 18 allow workers who are not related to sleep on the upper and lower levels of bunk beds if farm operators assign them to groups of up to 15 who remain separate from other workers. The practice is referred to as group shelters or cohorts. The union said the state regulations are “contrary to scientific evidence.” “We will keep fighting until the agencies pass rules that actually protect farm workers from COVID-19,” said Ramon Torres, president of Familias Unidas por la Justicia. Washington agricultural employers plan to bring about 30,000 farm workers from rural areas of Mexico under nonimmigrant, temporary H-2A work visas. Rosalinda Guillen of farm worker support organization Community to Community Development said the rules are offensive. “What they are saying is that our individual lives are worth sacrificing for industry profits. It’s acceptable to them to lump us together and subject us to the disease because those getting sick, and who may die, are poor brown people,” Guillen said. Democratic Gov. Jay Inslee said May 28 that proper adherence to the cohort model “can tremendously reduce the risk to agricultural workers because they are only exposed to a smaller group of people that can reside and travel and work together.” Inslee spokesman Mike Faulk said the governor’s office legal counsel is reviewing the lawsuit. State Department of Health spokeswoman Jessica Baggett said the agency could not comment on the lawsuit. Charleston: Low-contact youth sports teams in West Virginia can start practicing this week under Gov. Jim Justice’s move to continue lifting coronavirus restrictions. Middle and high school teams also can begin training Monday, and sports facilities such as indoor tennis and racquetball and outdoor basketball courts can reopen. Under the Republican governor’s orders, games involving youth teams can restart on June 22 with fans in the stands if social distancing rules are followed. Private and state park campgrounds, cabins and lodges are set to reopen to out-of-state guests Wednesday. At least 84 people in West Virginia have died from the virus and about 2,100 have tested positive, health officials said. Milwaukee:The Milwaukee County Zoo will partially reopen Saturday, allowing visitors to access the outside habitats. There will also be a limited daily capacity of visitors and Zoo Pass holders, according to a statement from County Executive David Crowley’s office. This is the first phase of a reopening plan. Visitors and Zoo Pass holders must make reservations online at www.milwaukeezoo.org and will receive timed, electronic tickets that will be scanned “at a safe distance,” according to the statement. Those who feel ill are asked to not come to the zoo. Visitors will receive an emailed ticket confirmation once a reservation is made. Whether it is printed or on a phone, the confirmation can be scanned from a distance. The zoo will be open from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. daily during this phase. The last entry time will be 1:30 p.m. Visitors will be required to wear masks, and anyone who has forgotten theirs will be issued a paper mask. Visitors can also buy masks at the zoo’s gift shop. Zoo staff members who work with the public will have to wear masks. Also, high-touch areas and areas where large numbers of people could congregate will not be accessible. Cheyenne: The state Department of Transportation plans to close 10 highway rest areas to save money amid a budget crisis. The closures starting June 15 will save about $800,000 a year, department officials said Friday. The department is closing rest areas near Lusk on U.S. Highway 18; Guernsey on U.S. 26; Greybull on U.S. 14-16-20; Moorcroft on Interstate 90; Star Valley on U.S. 89; Ft. Steele on I-80; Sundance on I-90; Upton on U.S. 16; and Orin Junction and Chugwater, both on I-25. Wyoming faces a two-year budget deficit of $1 billion or more because of the coronavirus pandemic and less revenue from its fossil-fuel extraction industry."
61,61,Experts warn large protests may 'become breeding grounds' for the coronavirusKen Alltucker and Karen Weintraub ,"Jun. 2, 2020",https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2020/06/01/george-floyd-protests-gatherings-increase-risk-coronavirus-spread-covid-19/5307140002/,"Public health officials warn new cases of COVID-19 probably will emerge after mass gatherings fueled by the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis and racial unrest in cities across America.  Health experts fear carriers of coronavirus, which causes the disease, with no symptoms could unwittingly infect others at protests where social distancing is simply not taking place. The merits of the protesters' cause ""doesn’t prevent them from getting the virus,” said Bradley Pollock, chairman of the Department of Public Health Sciences at the University of California, Davis. At least one protester in Tampa, Florida, is known to have COVID-19. Tampa Police Chief Brian Dugan, who expressed dismay last week about Floyd's death, tweeted Monday that five of his officers were exposed to the protester, whom he did not identify.  Protesting – especially without a mask – can put people at higher risk for infection, said Dr. Michael Mina, an assistant professor of epidemiology at Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health. ""There's no doubt in my mind that these can become breeding grounds for this virus,"" he said during a Monday media availability. ""I would not be surprised to see in the next couple of weeks that we see increases that may be linked to protests."" Timeline: George Floyd protests: How did we get here?  The human toll: 19 captivating images from this week's protests As businesses reopen, it will be difficult to figure out whether someone caught the virus at a protest or in some other encounter, Mina said. Hopefully, the fact that protests are taking place out of doors, will dilute the virus and reduce disease transmission, he said. Wearing a mask will help reduce infections, though it won't completely eliminate risk. ""If there's a floridly positive person who is coughing and spending a whole day around a lot of other people, that person might very well get other people sick despite having a mask on,"" Mina added, but ""there's a good chance that even homemade masks will actually do quite a bit to help people not get infected and not transmit."" There is a historical precedent to suggest viruses can be spread by large public gatherings. In September 1918, people in Philadelphia held a parade to support the war bond drive during World War I. The gathering of 200,000 people, crammed shoulder to shoulder, reignited a deadly flu epidemic, leading to massive closures and thousands of deaths, records show.  ""Obviously, that was the exact wrong time to have a parade in hindsight,"" said J. Alexander Navarro, assistant director of the Center for the History of Medicine at the University of Michigan. Navarro said he's concerned if there's a second wave of infections, we will face the same problem they did in 1918, when public support was lacking to shut down businesses a second time, leading to more deaths.  But former Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Tom Frieden said pandemic responses, ""should never be used as social control."" ""The science is clear. Outdoors is far, far less risky than indoors,""  said Frieden, who added wearing a mask further reduces risk. ""Trust in government is crucial for effective public health programs. Our leaders must earn and maintain that trust – lack of trust is the biggest threat to health and progress fighting the pandemic."" There's also a public health cost to not protesting the status quo, said Dr. Hillary Babcock, an infectious disease specialist at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, and immediate past president of the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America.  ""Systemic racism also causes large public health impacts and public health risks for large portions of our population,"" Babcock said.  She disagreed with calls for protesters to stay home to avoid fueling the outbreak. ""I don't think using public health as a reason to discourage protests after these events is really appropriate,"" Babcock said. ""It's a little disingenuous to say that the health risk from protesting is somehow bigger than the health risk at Lake of Ozarks (where people gathered for fun over Memorial Day weekend) or the practices that brought us to this point in the first place."" ‘You could see the train wreck coming’: Inexperienced, dubious companies among many aiming to cash in on coronavirus antibody tests At least one reveler at the Ozarks party tested positive for COVID-19, according to the Camden County Health Department. Others were advised to monitor for symptoms. Babcock said it is possible to minimize the risks of protesting, with masks, social distancing and asking sick people to stay home. Arresting people and putting them into close contact with others increases risk, Babcock said, as does spraying protesters with pepper spray, which causes violent coughing and can potentially spread the virus. Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency room physician and former Baltimore health commissioner, said there is risk of longer-term effects in communities disproportionately affected by COVID-19. Wen was Baltimore's health commissioner when protests erupted following the 2015 death of Freddie Gray. The death triggered civil unrest in communities already burdened with deep-seated inequities, she said.  ""When over a dozen pharmacies burned down and closed and stores were looted, it was community members themselves who were affected the most,"" Wen said. While protests over the past week following Floyd's death have highlighted police-community relations, demonstrators are also calling attention to social justice issues, including health disparities. ""The same communities that are already the most affected are potentially going to have an increase in the number of cases as a result of people gathering,"" Wen said. Melanie Campbell, president of the National Coalition on Black Civic Participation, said anger in the black community has been building for years. Floyd's death spurred them to take to the streets, even as the coronavirus has taken a disproportionate toll on African Americans. ""Black people are risking their lives protesting in the middle of a pandemic that’s killing black folks. That’s real,"" she said. ""There is no convenient time to fight back."" Resources and ways to donate:How you can take action from home after the death of George FloydMeanwhile, state and local public health agencies plan to monitor for new COVID-19 cases.  Any large gathering during a pandemic is a concern, said John C. Welch, director of partnerships and operations for the Massachusetts Covid Response project. Partners in Health, a Boston-based nonprofit, handles Massachusetts’ contact tracing of individuals infected with or exposed to the virus. Following such a large gathering, potential cases need to be monitored over two weeks, the virus’s incubation period. “The epidemic curve should guide the response and the phased reopening of society,"" Welch said. ""Until the epidemic is declared over, social distancing and wearing masks should remain the new normal."" Peter Pitts, president and co-founder of the Center for Medicine in the Public Interest, a nonpartisan research and educational organization, said he worries COVID-19 will take advantage of people gathering to protest police violence. ""Social distancing and social conflict are a very potent negative combination when it comes to spreading a virus,"" he said. ""The timing is highly unfortunate."" Public health concerns, which are usually complicated, can easily be drowned out by other ""sexier"" stories, he said, citing the recent SpaceX launch. But the virus ""doesn't cease to be a real threat because of other threats happening simultaneously,"" he said. ""That means we have to twice as smart and twice as dedicated and twice as focused."" "
62,62,"Fest cancellations, mixed-up results, unemployment slowdown: News from around our 50 statesFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports ","Jun. 5, 2020",https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/06/05/fest-cancellations-mixed-results-unemployment-slowdown-news-around-states/111909850/,"Montgomery: The state prison system said Wednesday that a second inmate has died after testing positive for COVID-19 as the number of cases among inmates and staff continued to rise. William Hershell Moon, a 74-year-old inmate at St. Clair Correctional Facility, died Wednesday at a hospital. “The Alabama Department of Corrections extends its sympathies to the Moon family and his loved ones during this difficult time,” the prison system said in a statement. The prison system said four other inmates housed in the same small living area as Moon also tested positive for COVID-19. That living area within St. Clair’s infirmary is on level-two quarantine, and the entire infirmary at St. Clair remains on level-one quarantine, the prison system said. A total of 19 inmates have tested positive for the novel coronavirus, according to the prison system. Ten of those are currently ill. Kenai: Three members of the Nikiski Fire Department have tested positive for COVID-19, and eight others were in quarantine pending test results, a spokesperson for the Kenai Peninsula Borough said Wednesday. Brenda Ahlberg said the 11 individuals were part of one shift. The borough’s emergency management office, in a release, said testing has been conducted for all department personnel. Ahlberg said that includes full-time staff and volunteers. Nikiski Fire Chief Bryan Crisp said the department will continue to follow federal health protocols and recommendations from the borough’s physician director, which include wearing protective gear and cleaning equipment. Personnel from other departments have agreed to help the Nikiski department, the release said. The local public health department is investigating the cases as part of efforts to determine whether others may need to be tested, KSRM radio reports. Glendale: State officials reported nearly 1,000 new coronavirus cases Wednesday amid a recent surge in hospitalizations, a little over two weeks after Gov. Doug Ducey ended his stay-at-home order. The surge of new cases of COVID-19 is a troubling sign for former state health director Will Humble, who said the timing is too close to be coincidence. “The one thing it does is it shows us that the stay-at-home order worked,” Humble said. “Because when it ended you see an increase in cases on the 26th, which is 10 days after it ended. You can look at it county by county by county and see the same thing.” The current director of the state Department of Health Services, Dr. Cara Christ, said there are other factors that could account for some of the increase, including greater testing. But she acknowledged the stay-home order’s end likely played a role. Little Rock: The state’s number of cases continued to rise Wednesday of the illness caused by the coronavirus outbreak, and officials say six more people have died. The Health Department said at least 8,067 people in the state have tested positive for the virus, an increase over the 7,818 reported Tuesday. The number of active cases, excluding those who have died or recovered, reached a new high of 2,208. The true number is likely higher because many people have not been tested, and studies suggest people can be infected and not feel sick. The number of people who have died in Arkansas from COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus, rose from 136 Tuesday to 142. Arkansas’ active cases have increased since late May as businesses that had closed because of the pandemic have been allowed to reopen. The state has also increased testing in recent weeks. Sacramento: Democratic legislative leaders have agreed on a budget they say covers the state’s estimated $54.3 billion deficit while avoiding most of Gov. Gavin Newsom’s proposed budget cuts to public education and health care services. The budget appears to hew many of Newsom’s expectations, including relying on the expectation that California will get significant federal funding to address the economic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic. It also includes Newsom’s proposed tax increase on some businesses, which is forecast to generate $4.4 billion annually, although it rejects $8 billion in cuts to public education Newsom included in his plan. If the federal money does not materialize, school districts would have to defer about $9 billion in costs to future years by borrowing or using reserves. Aurora: The Aurora Police Department announced Wednesday that officers are searching for three people suspected of violently attacking a woman in Target after the shopper asked the group to grant her more social distance. A man and two women bumped into the shopper inside the Target in Aurora on May 8 before the shopper then asked the group to give her more space, The Aurora Sentinel reports. The group began accosting the shopper and threw a box of tissues at her head before continuing to beat her, investigators said. The shopper suffered multiple broken bones. All three suspects, believed to be in their late teens to late 20s, were captured on surveillance footage leaving the store in a dark red SUV, authorities said. Police have encouraged anyone with any information to contact local authorities. Social distancing guidelines have been implemented to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Hartford: Some struggling immigrant families in the state without legal status will receive a share of $3.5 million in public and private money for COVID-19 relief. Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont announced Wednesday that $2.5 million in state-funded grants to landlords will be provided on behalf of renters who are ineligible for similar aid under the federal CARES Act. Additionally, the nonprofit philanthropic organization 4-CT plans to make $1 million – in the form of one-time debit cards in denominations of $200 or $400 – available to Connecticut families excluded from federal relief programs. Grassroots immigrant rights groups will help identify families for the financial assistance and send them to local clinics, where medical staff will first offer COVID-19 testing before providing the debit cards. The state has prioritized the testing of densely populated urban centers to keep track of future outbreaks of the coronavirus. Dover: The number of initial unemployment claims filed by Delawareans fell again last week to its lowest level since before the coronavirus pandemic struck. The Delaware Department of Labor reported Thursday that 3,052 initial unemployment claims were filed for the week ending May 30. That’s six times less than the number of claims filed in both the last week of March and the first week of April. Officials said more than 103,500 initial jobless claims have been filed since March 15 and more than $327 million in unemployment benefits paid. That total includes $209 million in federal funds and $117.5 million from Delaware’s unemployment insurance trust fund. By comparison, the fund paid out a total of $59 million in 2019. Jobless claims soared after Democratic Gov. John Carney imposed wide-ranging restrictions and closures on businesses in an effort to stem the spread of the virus. Washington: Georgetown aims to give pedestrians more room for social distancing by removing some street parking to make sidewalks wider, WTOP-FM reports. Several times in the past, the neighborhood has temporarily widened M Street and Wisconsin Avenue sidewalks for weekend events by using portable crowd control barriers. But that won’t work for longer-term plans. Orlando: The city’s First Presbyterian Church has made a donation of more than $500,000 to Central Florida’s nonprofits to help ease some of the economic devastation caused by the coronavirus. The church pooled money from from virtual collection plates and used leftover funds from a capital campaign, bequests and an annual missions drive, Senior Pastor David Swanson said. “We have what we call our Good Samaritan Fund to help people pay the light bill, pay the rent, make a car payment, pay the mortgage,” Swanson told the Orlando Sentinel. “Normally we get three, maybe four requests a month. But since COVID started, we’ve had 170. People are desperate.” In addition, church officials decided to support the region’s nonprofit agencies that feed, shelter and serve the tens of thousands of Central Florida workers who have been furloughed or laid off. Checks ranging from $5,000 to $50,000 will go to 14 charitable agencies in the area. Atlanta: The Legislature will resume session June 15 under an agreement announced by House and Senate leaders Wednesday. The 40-day legislative session was put on hold in March because of the coronavirus pandemic. House Speaker David Ralston and Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan announced the start date in a letter to members. Ralston and Duncan had to agree on when to restart under the terms of the resolution that halted the session March 13. The two previously had differing opinions on when to restart. When lawmakers reconvene, one of their biggest tasks will be grappling with a state budget that has been turned upside down by the pandemic. There have also been calls for Georgia to enact a hate crime law. Honolulu: Members of the U.S. military arriving in Hawaii will not be subjected to the state’s quarantine rule resulting from the coronavirus pandemic, but service members will follow a separate order restricting their movements. The Department of Homeland Security exempted military members from the state’s quarantine guidelines for arriving travelers, The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. But the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, which oversees operations in the state, said its own “restriction of movement” guidelines prohibit service members from going out for 14 days except for travel to places considered essential, such as grocery stores, doctors or pharmacies. The military order is less restrictive than the requirements for arriving civilian residents and tourists, who are required to stay in a dwelling for 14 days without traveling into the community. Boise: Federal officials on Thursday announced that a northern Idaho county with a drug-trafficking problem will be included in a regional enforcement network and will face a crackdown. The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration designated Kootenai County as part of the Idaho/Oregon High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area. The designation means that law enforcement agencies will get federal grant money and that federal, state, local and tribal police will be better able to coordinate activities and share information. “We will focus on drug traffickers, not users,” said Idaho State Police Capt. John Kempf. “Dealers – people who make money off the misery of people who are addicted to drugs.” Chicago: Three members of the Legislature want lawmakers to return to Springfield for an emergency legislative session to address criminal justice reform and rebuilding communities in the wake of “protests and subsequent civil unrest” in recent days. The Chicago Sun-Times reports that in a letter to House Speaker Mike Madigan and Senate President Don Harmon, Reps. Kam Buckner, Curtis Tarver and Lamont Robinson, all Democrats, say communities can’t wait until the fall veto session to address the unrest resulting from the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. “We are in a state of emergency and need to act immediately,” the lawmakers wrote. The COVID-19 pandemic has kept the General Assembly from Springfield, with lawmakers meeting in May for a four-day session to pass a budget and other legislation. At the time legislators adjourned May 24, Harmon said he didn’t think anyone was eager to return for a special session. Indianapolis: The state had about 24,000 people apply for unemployment benefits last week, following the national trend of slowing job losses after coronavirus-related business closures started in mid-March. Some 240,000 Indiana residents received jobless aid for the week ending May 23, according to U.S. Department of Labor statistics released Thursday. That is down from the peak of nearly 295,000 in early May just before statewide business and travel restrictions started being eased but still more than 10 times the level of early March. Gov. Eric Holcomb on Wednesday signed a 30-day extension of the state’s public health emergency until July 4, when he expects to lift most limits on businesses, large gatherings and entertainment activities. Indiana had the country’s fifth-highest unemployment rate for April at 16.9%, topping the national rate of 14.7%. Des Moines: Republican state lawmakers proposed a bill Wednesday that would offer broad protection from coronavirus lawsuits for doctors, hospitals, nursing homes, meatpacking plants, restaurants and other businesses. The measure, which is retroactive to Jan. 1, 2020, was tacked onto a medical malpractice bill that previously had passed the Senate. After swift passage in a House subcommittee and committee Wednesday, it’s eligible for House floor debate. If approved in the House, the Senate only needs to agree with the new language, and it would go to the governor for her consideration. Democratic Rep. Brian Meyer, a lawyer, unsuccessfully attempted to amend the measure to require business owners to prove they followed government guidelines and federal and state laws to get protection from lawsuits. Topeka: A bill giving lawmakers some oversight of the state’s coronavirus response cleared the House on Wednesday night and is headed to the Senate. The Legislature convened for a special session called by Gov. Laura Kelly after she vetoed a sweeping coronavirus bill GOP lawmakers approved in May moments before adjourning their annual session. That measure would have curbed Kelly’s power to direct the state’s pandemic response; given legislative leaders the final say over how $1.25 billion in federal relief funds are spent; and protected businesses, medical providers and nursing homes from lawsuits. Kelly’s staff and top Republicans have been negotiating since then. GOP lawmakers unveiled a new plan Tuesday that also would give legislators oversight of spending, prevent coronavirus-related lawsuits, and limit Kelly’s ability to close businesses statewide this fall and winter. The vote in the House was 107-12. Frankfort: A 9-month-old who tested positive for COVID-19 was among eight more people whose deaths were related to the coronavirus in Kentucky, Gov. Andy Beshear announced Wednesday. The latest deaths raised the statewide death toll to 450 since the pandemic began. In announcing the infant’s death, Beshear said: “Far too often, people think that it’s something that only happens to medically compromised seniors. This is a reminder of how deadly this virus can be. How precious all of our lives are.” Dr. Steven Stack, Kentucky’s public health commissioner, said it’s not conclusive that the infant from Hopkins County died as a direct result of COVID-19. The state’s reporting methodology is to list her death as a coronavirus-related death since she tested positive for the virus. “It is possible that COVID did directly contribute to the death,” he said. “It’s also possible that it did not. It may be one of those things we never come to find out for sure.” New Orleans: About two-thirds of those who are eligible have signed up for a program aimed at making sure children from low-income families can get healthy meals while schools are closed for the coronavirus pandemic, the state education department said Wednesday. The deadline for signing up for the Pandemic Electronic Benefits Transfer program is Monday. The federal program is aimed at families of children in pre-kindergarten through 12th grade who normally receive free or reduced-price meals at school. Families can apply through a P-EBT portal on the Louisiana Department of Education website. The department said applications have been submitted on behalf of 403,731 children – about 66% of those eligible. Louisiana schools have been closed since March 16 as the state fought the spread of the virus. Portland: Higher education leaders released a framework for reopening the state’s colleges and universities Thursday that prioritizes on-campus learning in the fall. The guidelines are the product of a working group that includes University of Maine System Chancellor Dannel Malloy. The guidelines state that Maine will give “the strongest consideration to make in-person, on-campus experiences available in Maine institutions as widely as possible for the fall 2020 term” and beyond. It also states that higher education leaders in Maine will let science and data inform the reopening. The reopening framework states that colleges and universities in Maine will stay in consultation as institutions begin to open. It’s intended to serve as a guide for decision making by the institutions. Annapolis: The state will begin its second stage of reopening later this week by lifting the order that closed nonessential businesses in response to the coronavirus, Gov. Larry Hogan announced Wednesday. The order will be lifted Friday at 5 p.m., enabling large and small retail shops to open, as well as wholesalers and warehouses. Offices including information technology firms, legal offices, and banking and financial institutions can open as well. Hogan said personal services such as nail salons and tanning salons can reopen with 50% capacity and by appointment only. Face coverings will be encouraged whenever face-to-face interactions take place, Hogan said. Businesses are also being encouraged to implement a screening process, including temperature checks for personnel. The governor emphasized that just because people will be allowed to return to work doesn’t mean they necessarily should. Boston: The next phase in getting the state back in business, including reopening child care centers, could start as soon as Monday if downward trends in the coronavirus pandemic continue, Gov. Charlie Baker said. The official announcement on Phase 2 of the reopening plan will come Saturday, Baker said at a news conference Wednesday. Child care centers, which currently are open only to children of emergency workers, will need to screen staffers and youngsters for symptoms of illness before allowing them in each day. Centers must use only one entrance, stagger drop-off schedules and try to avert close contact between children. At summer camps, attendees will have to stay in their groups, counselors won’t be able to move among groups, and field trips will be banned for now. Retails stores that open their floors in Phase 2 must limit occupancy, require face masks and – for groceries and pharmacies – create special hours for customers older than 60. Lenox Township: More than 100 prisoners in southeastern Michigan were given the wrong results of coronavirus tests, the Corrections Department said. Fifty-four men were told they tested positive while another 54 were told they tested negative at Macomb Correctional Center. The results were actually the reverse, spokesman Chris Gautz said. The mistake led to prisoners subsequently being housed in wrong areas, Gautz said. The Corrections Department recently finished testing the statewide population of 38,000 prisoners. About 10% were infected, and 68 prisoners have died, including five at Macomb. “We were a facility that had one of the largest outbreaks in the state, and you’re still making mistakes like this?” prisoner Jamie Meade said. St. Paul: Another 29 Minnesotans have died from COVID-19, and 404 more people have tested positive for the disease, according to Thursday’s report from the Minnesota Department of Health. The Benedict Homes assisted living facility in Sherburne Countty was added to the list of congregate care facilities with outbreaks of the virus Thursday. Statewide, the number of people who tested positive for the novel coronavirus reached 26,273 on Thursday, and 1,115 people have died, according to MDH. Of those cases, 3,253 have required hospitalization, and 512 remained hospitalized Thursday. Of those hospitalized, 244 are in intensive care. Across the state, 21,490 coronavirus patients no longer need isolation. Philadelphia: The 2020 edition of “Mississippi’s Giant Houseparty” is being canceled because of concern about the coronavirus pandemic. Directors of the Neshoba County Fair said in a statement Wednesday that they’ve been consulting with public health officials and determined it would not be possible to ensure that people “safely and effectively” follow guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control. The fair typically attracts tens of thousands of people to the red clay hills of east central Mississippi. Extended groups of families and friends live in cabins on the campgrounds for more than a week, and crowds are even larger on the two days that politicians speak under the main pavilion on the fairgrounds. The fair also has a midway, musical performances and horseracing. The fair dates back to the 1890s and has previously been canceled only during World War II. Osage Beach: No additional cases of the new coronavirus have been reported stemming from the crowded pool parties at Missouri’s Lake of the Ozarks over Memorial Day weekend, the state’s top health official said. Camden County Health Department reported Friday that a person from Boone County who had attended the parties tested positive for the virus. Speaking at a news conference in Jefferson City on Wednesday, Dr. Randall Williams, the director of the Department of Health and Senior Services, said no more cases have been uncovered since, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. Social media postings of the event showed large crowds of mostly young people without masks and not adhering to social distancing guidelines at pools along the central Missouri lake that is a popular weekend getaway spot. The pictures and video of crowds at the lake prompted a public outcry and led health officials to urge anyone who attended the parties to self-quarantine for 14 days. Helena: Applications for unemployment payments in Montana declined last week as the state continues to lift closures put in place to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, officials said Thursday. The number of new applications for job assistance submitted in Montana last week fell to 2,874, according to the U.S. Employment and Training Administration. That’s a decrease of nearly 25% from the 3,821 claims filed a week earlier but an increase of nearly 280% from the number of applications submitted at the same time last year. Montana has processed 108,572 claims for unemployment since March 14. That represents 23.8% of the total workforce eligible for the unemployment insurance program. As of May 23, 47,350 Montana residents were receiving unemployment benefits, which is 10.4% of all eligible employees. Omaha: Six more people have died from the coronavirus in the state, and officials have confirmed 255 new cases, according to the state’s online tracking portal. The number of known cases rose to 14,866, and the number of deaths has reached 187 as of Wednesday night. More than 112,400 people have been tested. Hospital capacity is relatively stable, with 42% of hospital beds, 46% of intensive care unit beds and 75% of ventilators available for use. Gov. Pete Ricketts had been scheduled to answer media questions about the coronavirus Thursday but canceled that plan, saying he was doing so out of respect for the nationally televised memorial service of George Floyd, the black man whose death in Minneapolis police custody has triggered national protests. Carson City: The state has seen more than a month of declining rates of coronavirus-related hospitalizations and positive tests for COVID-19, Gov. Steve Sisolak said Thursday. The governor said in a statement that Nevada has made significant progress meeting five benchmarks he set in late April in order to start easing restrictions on gatherings and business closures. The Democrat said Nevadans who took the threat of the virus seriously helped the state “to slowly begin to reopen its communities and the economy on the path to a new normal.” Nevada has seen the rate of positive COVID-19 cases drop for at least 39 days, with 5.7% of all people having the disease out of everyone tested. The rate of hospitalizations has declined for 43 days, the state has the ability to test patients who don’t show symptoms of the virus, and Nevada has set up a contact tracing system. The state also has the ability to intervene in any outbreaks, and all nursing homes have been inspected. Concord: The temporary expansion of telehealth during the coronavirus pandemic would become permanent under a bill considered Thursday by a Senate committee. As passed by the House in March, the bill would allow reimbursement for medication-assisted treatment for substance use disorders conducted via telehealth. But an amendment before the Senate Health and Human Services Committee would also make permanent the provisions of Gov. Chris Sununu’s emergency order on telehealth, which allowed all health care providers to offer services via phone, video and other remote systems and required insurers to cover them. Officials representing hospitals, community health centers, dentists and mental health providers all told the committee that telehealth has been a valuable tool during the pandemic and should continue. Trenton: Gov. Phil Murphy on Wednesday unveiled and endorsed recommendations on improving nursing homes’ responses to outbreaks after COVID-19 ravaged long-term care facilities in the state. The 100-page report calls for improving nursing homes’ emergency response by consolidating operations for all facilities in a single center. The plan also calls for increasing wages and ensuring access to paid sick leave. The report was compiled by consultants at the firm Manatt, which Murphy’s administration hired for $500,000, according to records obtained under the open records act. New Jersey’s long-term care facilities have been had hit by the outbreak, accounting for nearly half of the state’s fatalities from the virus. Murphy reported Wednesday that there were 5,076 lab-confirmed deaths among residents and staff at long-term care facilities. Santa Fe: State health officials say they have confirmed 25 more coronavirus cases among federal inmates being held at a lockup in southern New Mexico. The state Health Department on Wednesday said the cases from the prison in Otero County brought the statewide total to 8,140. More than 160 state inmates being held at the same facility also have tested positive. The state also reported eight additional deaths – all from McKinley and San Juan counties. Those areas have been hit the hardest and account for more than half of New Mexico’s infections. More than 40 long-term care and acute care facilities around the state also have reported at least one case among residents and staff over the past month. New York: The state began to allow outdoor dining at restaurants as soon as Thursday in much of the state outside of New York City and its suburbs as coronavirus restrictions ease, after Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced the move Wednesday. Restaurants must place outdoor tables 6 feet apart, all staff must wear face coverings, and customers must also wear a covering when not seated, under the rules Cuomo announced in a news release. The order applies to regions that have entered the second phase of Cuomo’s four-step reopening plan, including the Capital region, western New York, central New York and the Finger Lakes. The areas that will have to wait for outdoor dining include Long Island and the mid-Hudson Valley, which entered the first phase of reopening last week, and New York City, which is scheduled to enter the first phase next week. Raleigh: The General Assembly wants to let more young people begin driving on their own even though the North Carolina DMV isn’t currently offering required behind-the-wheel tests due to COVID-19 health worries. The full House and a Senate committee approved separate measures Wednesday that would set aside the behind-the-wheel test for teenagers seeking a limited provisional license and help ease a bottleneck of applicants. A young person still must log 60 hours of driving with a parent to seek such a permit. The House bill would waive the road-test mandate for these youths until the Division of Motor Vehicles administered them again or for six months, whichever date is later. A legislative lobbyist for the Department of Transportation, which oversees the DMV, told House Rules Committee members that the agency supported the waiver. Bismarck: Health officials said Thursday that 27 additional people have tested positive for COVID-19 in the state, bringing its total to 2,706 cases. North Dakota has confirmed 66 deaths from complications of the coronavirus, but none were reported Thursday. Officials said 1,242 people have been screened since Wednesday, bringing the total tested in North Dakota to 104,888. Twenty of the positive cases reported Thursday were in Cass County, which has been the epicenter of the state’s coronavirus outbreak. They county that contains Fargo now has a total of 1,803 confirmed cases. Thirty-two people were hospitalized Thursday, down two from the day before. Columbus: A proposal by House Republicans to require individuals’ written consent for the state to track the spread of the coronavirus was rejected by fellow Republicans in the Ohio Senate on Wednesday. The House would have required in-writing permission before the Health Department could undertake what is known as contact tracing. This technique allows investigators to reach out to people who have been in close and recent proximity to someone who tests positive for COVID-19. The proposal reflected the disagreement many conservative House Republicans have with GOP Gov. Mike DeWine’s response to the coronavirus, which they feel has gone too far. But Senate Republicans joined by Democrats said the proposal itself went too far and could rule out people willing to allow the tracing but unable to sign a form if, for example, they were out of town. Contact tracing is considered essential to tracking a contagious illness as a means of slowing it down. Oklahoma City: The Oklahoma State Department of Health on Wednesday reversed course on its decision from earlier this week to no longer release COVID-19 infection data by city and zip code. The agency made the move after consulting with Attorney General Mike Hunter, who advised them releasing epidemiological information for statistical purposes is legal as long as no individual person can be identified. Hunter said in a statement that the release of the more detailed infection data by locality “threads the needle of providing up-to-date information to the public while protecting the privacy of Oklahomans.” Lawyers for the health department and the governor’s office had made a decision earlier this week to no longer release the data because of state medical privacy laws. They claimed they had previously been able to release the data under the expired Catastrophic Health Emergency Powers Act. Portland: The state hasn’t seen a coronavirus resurgence in the weeks since most counties began to slowly reopen businesses, the state’s top health official said Wednesday. Oregon Health Authority Director Patrick Allen spoke of declining hospitalizations and infection rates as evidence that the spread of COVID-19 remains mild, even as new reported cases increased slightly in recent days, The Oregonian/OregonLive reports. Allen credited Oregonians for taking steps to reduce their risk of infection, such as wearing face coverings in public and continuing to practice social distancing. “I think it’s safe to say our situation is stable,” he said in a news conference with Gov. Kate Brown. “As stores, salons and restaurants have reopened across the state, COVID-19 has not reemerged with renewed ferocity.” Throughout the pandemic, Oregon has had one of the nation’s lowest infection and death rates among known cases. Harrisburg: The coronavirus has infected another 537 people and killed another 75 in Pennsylvania, the state Health Department said Thursday, even as the rate of new cases and the percentage of those testing positive continues to decline. The agency said it has now confirmed nearly 74,000 cases and a total of 5,817 deaths because of the virus in Pennsylvania in the past three months. On Friday, Gov. Tom Wolf’s administration is expected to lift more restrictions, as it previously announced it would. Nearly 6 million people in Philadelphia and seven other counties in hard-hit southeastern Pennsylvania are scheduled Friday to become the last in the state to shed the tightest restrictions under Wolf’s stoplight-colored three-phase reopening plan. That includes the stay-at-home order that is part of the so-called red phase. Providence: State Department of Health staff will be posted to all future peaceful protests seeking justice in the death of George Floyd to help reduce the chances that the coronavirus spreads at them, Gov. Gina Raimondo said Wednesday. The staff will distribute masks and provide information about symptom monitoring and how to get tested, the Democratic governor said. Raimondo said while she supports the constitutional rights of people to demonstrate, she is concerned about large gatherings leading to an outbreak of the disease. “I feel like these protests should be allowed to occur … so that people can participate in democracy and advocate for change,” she said. “Having said that, it doesn’t mean that we can forget that the virus still with us.” She also asked protesters to think of their families, especially if they live with any older, vulnerable relatives. Columbia: State health officials issued a warning Wednesday that people who go to graduations, businesses or other recently opened places and aren’t careful about wearing masks or social distancing may be contributing to an increase in COVID-19 cases in the state. But they also said the state likely won’t shut down businesses again, saying damaging the economy doesn’t help anyone. People need to take responsibility for their own safety, they said. For the past week, health officials had mostly blamed a significant increase in testing for the spiked numbers. But the messaging changed Wednesday. They cited people not taking precautions at graduation parties and other large gatherings as a possible contributor and urged people to wash their hands, wear masks in public, keep 6 feet away from others and stay at home when possible. “People are getting pretty comfortable with being out and about and not practicing social distancing and not wearing a mask,” said Dr. Joan Duwve, Director of Public Health for the Department of Health and Environmental Control. Sioux Falls: The state on Thursday reported two new deaths from COVID-19, bringing its death toll to 64, according to the Department of Health. The state also reported 85 new cases of the virus and has recorded 5,247 cases so far. About 80% of those have recovered, but 86 people are currently hospitalized with COVID-19. Over the past two weeks, the rolling average number of daily new cases has remained mostly constant at about 64 per day. One person who died was in their 60s, and the other was over the age of 80. The economic impacts of the pandemic continued to cause layoffs in the state as 1,435 people made new claims for unemployment benefits in the week ending May 30. But that was a decrease of new claims by more than half from the previous week. A total of 19,593 people in South Dakota were receiving unemployment benefits as of May 23. That represents 4.7% of all eligible employees in the state. Memphis: The state delivered unemployment payments to more than 314,000 people last week, as the number of new jobless claims continued to run much higher than normal during the response to the new coronavirus outbreak. Stay-at-home orders from Gov. Bill Lee and city and county officials in mid-March led to business closures and hundreds of thousands of layoffs, as officials scrambled to stem the rise of COVID-19. Businesses have begun to gradually reopen in recent weeks, and many workers have been able to return to their jobs. But the number of new weekly filings is still high, with some businesses remaining closed and employers cutting staff as they operate at a limited capacity due to social distancing rules. More than 22,700 new unemployment claims were filed during the week ending Saturday, the Tennessee Department of Labor & Workforce Development said Thursday. Austin: Bars, restaurants and retailers will be allowed to serve more customers – in some cases immediately – under new orders from Republican Gov. Greg Abbott on Wednesday to further open the state economy amid the coronavirus pandemic. Abbott’s order for “Phase 3” of the restart also allows for outdoor Fourth of July celebrations of 500 or more at the discretion of local officials. Retailers are allowed to expand to 50% capacity immediately, and the same applies to bars as long as patrons are seated. Restaurants can serve groups as large as 10 and can expand to 75% total capacity starting June 12. The order also allows amusement parks to gradually expand capacity. All are supposed to follow health and social distancing standards recommended by state and federal officials. The new order comes just three days after the state set a single-day high of positive tests. Texas has reported three of its four highest days of positive tests since March within the past week. Salt Lake City: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints said Thursday that it will hold its twice-yearly signature conference in October without an in-person audience, as it did in April, because of lingering concerns about the coronavirus pandemic. The conferences usually bring some 100,000 people to the church conference center in Salt Lake City to attend five sessions over two days. Instead, church leaders will be inside a small auditorium with only a few other people Oct. 3-4 as the speeches are broadcast live online around the world. “As a worldwide organization, we have an obligation to be good citizens and to act with caution as it relates to such a unique setting as general conference, which traditionally brings thousands of visitors to Salt Lake City from around the globe,” the church’s top leaders said in a letter to members. Burlington: Testing for COVID-19 is available to college students returning to the University of Vermont and Champlain College. The specimen collection is being done by the Vermont Department of Health with help from trained members of the Vermont National Guard at sites on the UVM campus. Testing for UVM students starts Monday and will continue weekdays through June 16. Champlain College students can get tested on June 9, 11 and 16. The Champlain Student Health Center is coordinating the testing for Champlain students. Testing hours are 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. at all sites. Local residents may also get tested June 3-6 and June 17-19. Appointments are needed for all tests. UVM students may make an appointment through the school’s MyWellbeing secure health information portal. Champlain students can call the student health center to sign up, and area residents can register online. Chincoteague: The town is working with the county to support local businesses hit hard by the novel coronavirus pandemic. At its meeting this week, the town council agreed that hotels, motels, restaurants and other businesses affected by the virus should be given as much support as possible through the federal CARES Act. During the meeting, council members discussed how funding from the CARES Act will be used to support the town. Town manager Mike Tolbert explained that Accomack County will receive money first, and citizens of the county, including Chincoteague, will be able to request funding to assist their business. Tolbert added that nonprofits will not qualify for funding from the CARES Act and that the county’s plan is to work on a first-come, first-serve basis. Seattle: The city’s school district says it will soon decide how the next school year will operate given the current coronavirus pandemic. The district moved largely online since it first shut down all buildings March 12 due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Gov. Jay Inslee on April 6 issued an emergency order to keep schools across the state closed through the end of the school year. Washington state’s largest school system, which has about 50,000 students, announced Tuesday that it’s considering three options, including fully remote learning. Seattle Public Schools is also considering an option for the fall that would have children in pre-kindergarten through fifth grade on campus full time, while students in middle and high school would take on an alternating schedule in which they would spend part of their time in-person, and the other part would be remote learning. The third option is for all students to split their time between the classroom and online. Charleston: About 4,500 West Virginians filed for unemployment aid last week despite the gradual reopening of businesses in the state, according to federal statistics released Thursday. The filings are slightly down from the previous week, though they remain historically high. State officials said they have received 250,000 unemployment claims in the past 10 weeks. West Virginia’s unemployment rate hit 15% in April, the last recorded month. Nationwide, nearly 1.9 million people filed for jobless benefits last week. Thursday’s latest weekly number from the U.S. Department of Labor is still more than double the record high that prevailed before the viral outbreak. Republican Gov. Jim Justice has allowed most businesses to reopen under his phased plan to lift virus restrictions. On Friday, casinos and movie theaters can resume operations. Justice on Thursday also announced that fairs and festivals can begin again July 1. Milwaukee: The lakeside festival that draws hundreds of thousands of people to downtown Milwaukee each summer has canceled the event after earlier moving it to September. Summerfest officials said Thursday that out of an “abundance of caution” for fans, artists, vendors and staff, the event will not take place this year. Summerfest CEO Don Smiley said staff explored numerous options to operate the festival in a safe manner in light of the coronavirus outbreak but could not find acceptable alternatives. Summerfest, which bills itself as the world’s largest music festival, said it has a $186 million economic impact annually. Organizers were to unveil the new $53 million American Family Insurance Amphitheater during the festival this year. Summerfest, which began in 1968, is held at Henry Maier Festival Park, adjacent to Lake Michigan. It draws 800,000 to 900,000 people each summer. Cheyenne: Applications for temporary unemployment assistance in the state declined during the week ending May 30 as the U.S. economy continued to struggle with measures to contain the coronavirus, officials said Thursday. The number of applications submitted in Wyoming fell to 1,926, down 31% from the previous week but still up 338% compared to the same week last year, according to the U.S. Employment and Training Administration. Wyoming has processed 43,444 claims for unemployment since March 14. That represents 16% of Wyoming’s total workforce eligible for the unemployment insurance program. Wyoming’s fossil-fuel extraction and tourism industries have been especially hard-hit by the coronavirus. Coal companies have laid off or furloughed hundreds of workers amid a decline in demand for electricity. Many restaurants and lodges remain closed. From USA TODAY Network and wire reports"
63,63,Georgia's Smart: Players will be safer working out on campus,"May 28, 2020",https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaf/2020/05/28/georgias-smart-players-will-be-safer-working-out-on-campus/111876714/,"ATLANTA (AP) — As he prepares to welcome his players back to campus, Georgia coach Kirby Smart insisted Thursday that they'll be safer working out under the school's supervision than on their own. Smart also called on fans to comply with guidelines for dealing with the coronavirus pandemic, warning that a spike in cases could ruin any hopes of playing football in the fall. “The longer this thing has gone on, the more people begin to relax and say, ‘Well, this won’t affect me,'"" Smart said from Athens during a video call with reporters. “The last thing we need right now, if people want to have a football season or any athletic season, is to have another flare-up.” The Southeastern Conference voted last week to reopen athletic facilities for voluntary workouts beginning June 8, lifting a ban that had been in effect since the sports world shut down in March. Smart said no one will be forced to return to campus if they don't feel safe. “There’s obviously some apprehension and questions, but they have those same questions whether they are in Huntsville or in Macon or in Columbus,” he said. ""I know that our facility is one of the safest, and we certainly have the ability to care for that facility better than a lot of places they can go back home.” Smart pointed to a rigid protocol set up the Georgia's longtime director of sports medicine, Ron Courson, one of the nation's most respected athletic trainers. The Bulldogs will work in small groups, giving them plenty of room to spread out in the school's spacious weight room. A cleaning crew will go through the facility after each session. The locker rooms will not be used. “They’ll work out in smaller groups than traditionally before, probably 20 or so guys to a group, and of the 20 that come in, they’ll be subdivided into groups of seven,” Smart said. “So you’re looking at a seven-person rotation in a 1,200-square-foot weight room and they’ll be spaced out."" Also, Georgia is planning to test and give a full medical screening to every player. “It's not going to be the normal,” Smart said. “It’s going to be completely different.” While the workouts are supposedly on a voluntary basis, many have scoffed at the notion that a player competing for a starting job would not return to campus because of health or safety concerns. “There is no pressure,” Smart said. “But if you ask these players, every one of them, to a man, is going to tell you they've been working out at home. I would argue that the home environment — whether that's a local gym or the local high school or their backyard, anywhere they're working out — is not more safe than one that is professionally cleaned and monitored and taken care of by our staff. ""As a parent, I would certainly feel much better about my son or daughter going to work in that environment than where they're working out currently.” If a player does test positive, he will have the choice of returning home or being quarantined on campus. Contact tracing will allow the school to determine if anyone else has been infected, Smart said. “We are not looking really far out of what is going to happen in the season,” the coach added. “We are looking at June and the immediate issues there.” Smart declined to say whether he thinks the season actually will be played, or how it might look. NASCAR has resumed racing without fans in the stands, a model that nearly every other sport seems resigned to follow. “We’ve got three months,"" Smart said. ""I’m very optimistic we’ll have fans in the stands, but to what extent, I have no clue and I don’t really want to speculate.” Georgia will ensure that players are aware of safety guidelines such as masks and social distancing, which help to limit the coronavirus from spreading. “We’re going to educate our players, because I promise you, there are some of our players that don’t feel vulnerable,” Smart said. ""They feel like they’re not vulnerable because of what they’ve heard, or because they think they have superpowers. “We’re going to have education sessions, even when they get back, to give us the best opportunity to have a season.” ___ Follow Paul Newberry on Twitter at https://twitter.com/pnewberry1963 and find his work at https://apnews.com ___ More AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25"
64,64,"Theme parks, speedy clocks, rent relief: News from around our 50 statesFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports ","Jun. 7, 2020",https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/06/07/theme-parks-speedy-clocks-rent-relief-news-around-states/111918816/,"Foley: An amusement park on the coast has joined the state’s push to reopen its economy amid the global pandemic. The Owa theme park said temperature checks on visitors and capacity limits were being used to help reduce the threat of the new coronavirus as it reopened over the weekend in Foley. It also said hand sanitizing stations have been added around the property. The park, which reopened Friday afternoon, is the latest attraction to reopen as Alabama tries to reinvigorate businesses that closed to avoid spreading disease. Alabama Adventure and Splash Adventure in Bessemer reopened previously, and a statement posed on social media said its season passes are nearly sold out. Owa is owned by the Poarch Creek Band of Indians. Anchorage: Mayor Ethan Berkowitz signed an emergency order Friday implementing more stringent coronavirus-related restrictions on out-of-state travelers compared to state regulations. Travelers from outside Alaska are now able to avoid a statewide mandatory 14-day quarantine if they test negative for COVID-19, but the city of Anchorage has imposed additional regulations that limit some visitors’ interactions with residents, the Anchorage Daily News reports. Under the current state mandate, out-of-state travelers will need to show proof of their negative COVID-19 results upon arriving in Alaska. Once in the state, travelers are urged to limit interactions until 14 days have passed, until they test negative again in a second test taken seven to 14 days after arrival, or until they leave the state, whichever comes first. Flagstaff: Northern Arizona University will start and end the fall semester earlier this year to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, the university said. President Rita Cheng announced in an email Thursday that classes will start Aug. 12 and end before Thanksgiving Day. The semester was previously scheduled from Aug. 24 to Dec. 11. “Our goal is to take advantage of a period of expected lower COVID-19 case rates, exceptional weather for encouraging outdoor activities, and lower rates of student travel, prior to any potential resurgence of the virus,” Cheng said. The university plans to increase cleaning and sanitation measures, require facial coverings in common areas, and maintain social distancing guidelines and protocols for testing and screening, Cheng said. All three state universities expect to resume in-person classes this fall and are working on plans to ensure a safe return. Little Rock: State officials say they are working to double the size of Arkansas’ team of contact tracers – individuals who identify people who might have had contact with those infected by the coronavirus. Little Rock television station KATV reports State Secretary of Health Dr. Nate Smith said the current team of about 240 people is “stretched” as hundreds of new cases are identified each day. The increase in cases comes amid a surge in testing and increased spread of the virus among Latinos and younger people, state health officials said. The contact tracing team will be expanded in the coming weeks and months, Smith said at a news conference Friday. Gov. Asa Hutchinson said Friday that he hoped the state’s growth in new coronavirus cases had begun to level off. The total number of people who have tested positive for the virus rose to 9,101, an increase of 450, health officials announced Saturday. A total of 154 people have died, up two from Friday. Sacramento: The state will allow schools, day camps, bars, gyms and professional sports with modifications to begin reopening starting next Friday. Mark Ghaly, the state’s top health official, said the state plans to release guidance Friday for counties to follow to reopen a broad range of businesses that have been closed since mid-March because of concerns about spreading the coronavirus. The guidelines were not immediately available. The rules on schools and day camps will apply statewide. But only counties that have met certain thresholds on the number of cases, testing and preparedness will be allowed to start reopening the other sectors. Gov. Gavin Newsom has been moving the state through a methodical four-step process for reopening. Most of the new businesses are part of “Phase 3.” Nail salons will not be included in the list. Denver: Recreational activities in the state were given a boost late last week. The Colorado Department of Public Health released new guidelines to allow the opening of many recreational activities. The softening of guidelines still comes with restrictions in most areas as precautions against the spread of the novel coronavirus continue. The new guidelines come after draft guidelines were reviewed and after Gov. Jared Polis encouraged outdoor recreation while extending the safer-at-home order earlier last week. Among the changes: Rafting services can open, some adult and youth sports leagues can begin operations, and swimming pools can open. Hartford: Gov. Ned Lamont announced Friday that he is moving up the second phase of reopening many businesses and activities by three days so the changes don’t conflict with Father’s Day weekend. In a statement posted on Twitter, the Democrat said Phase 2 will now happen June 17 instead of June 20. That’s when movie theaters, tattoo parlors, spas, gyms, fitness studios, bowling alleys and amusement parks, and nail salons will be allowed to open again, and restaurants can resume indoor dining. Libraries and some youth sports programs will also be allowed to reopen. Bars, however, will not. On Thursday, state Chief Operating Officer Josh Geballe said the state is “targeting” June 20 to possibly allow up to 50-person outdoor events, such as weddings, with larger events to follow, possibly a month later. It’s unclear whether Lamont’s revamped executive order will affect those outdoor events. Dover: Gov. John Carney has formally extended Delaware’s state of emergency over the coronavirus pandemic through the end of June. The emergency was first declared in mid-March and must be extended every 30 days. The emergency order includes requirements for residents to wear face masks in public and restrictions on business operations to limit spread of the virus. The state has for the past two weeks been lifting some of Carney’s original restrictions – reopening beaches, short-term rentals, retail businesses and dine-in services at restaurants with limited capacity. Many restaurants and businesses were allowed to reopen June 1, but it didn’t trigger the economic reawakening the state had hoped for, as many stores remained closed over fears of the coronavirus and looting. Churches were also allowed to resume services over the weekend, with many religious leaders saying they would implement social distancing rules. Washington: The trend for new coronavirus cases in D.C. has mostly been flat since reopening began, WUSA-TV reports. On Saturday the district announced 9,269 total cases of the virus as protests and crowds grew downtown amid a worldwide movement against police brutality and the killings of black men and women. D.C. has so far reported 483 deaths from the virus. Orlando: Universal Orlando Resort, bars, movie theaters and other entertainment venues reopened with restrictions in most of Florida on Friday as the state took another step away from the economic shutdown caused by the coronavirus outbreak. Also allowed to reopen were bowling alleys, tattoo and massage parlors, and arcades in most of the state. Bars, theaters, concert halls and bowling alleys must limit their capacity to 50% of normal and keep groups at least 6 feet apart – restrictions restaurants statewide have been using. Massage, tattoo, tanning and similar parlors must employ masks, limit times in waiting areas and sanitize work areas between customers. Barbershops, hair stylists and nail salons have been operating under similar restrictions statewide. However, bars, movie theaters, and these other entertainment and personal services businesses remain closed in state’s three most-populous, hardest-hit counties – Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach. Atlanta: Police could be spreading the coronavirus by spraying tear gas on demonstrators, an Emory University infectious disease specialist said Friday as the number of confirmed infections in Georgia surpassed 50,000. Mass arrests and confining people in small spaces also dramatically increase the risk of infecting others with the coronavirus, Dr. Jay Varkey said Friday. Tear gas and other chemical agents causes people to rub their eyes, putting demonstrators at risk of being infected, Varkey said. “When I see the wide use of things like tear gas or pepper bombs that by its nature cause people to immediately rub their eyes, that causes me tremendous consternation in terms of the risk of what that could cause in terms of infection transmission during a pandemic,” Varkey said. “From a public health standpoint, I don’t know whether law enforcement is actively looking at agents other than tear gas or pepper bombs. As a physician, do I think they should? Yes, absolutely.” Wailuku: The electric company and the coronavirus are responsible for the state’s residents moving into the future faster than other Americans. Unprecedented declines in energy use and power generation during the pandemic created a slight electrical frequency disruption, The Maui News reports. The deviation has resulted in several reports of electric clocks running a few minutes fast on Maui. Hawaiian Electric said the reduced electricity use is largely a result of mass closures of hotels and other businesses across the state. The economic disruption followed the implementation in March of health and movement restrictions for residents and a mandatory quarantine for travelers arriving from outside the state. “We saw a significant reduction in use of electricity as tourism activities ceased, businesses closed, and thousands of residents stayed home to slow the spread of COVID-19,” Hawaiian Electric spokeswoman Shayna Decker said. Boise: More than 60% of the state’s coronavirus-related deaths are among residents of long-term care facilities like nursing homes, according to numbers released by the state Friday. The Idaho Department of Health and Welfare said that so far 25 long-term care facilities have reported COVID-19 outbreaks since the pandemic reached Idaho’s borders earlier this year. A total of 289 residents and staffers at the facilities were confirmed to have the illness, according to the report, and of them 52 people have died. Statewide, more than 3,000 people have contracted COVID-19, and 83 people have died, according to a tally from Johns Hopkins University. The Idaho Department of Health and Welfare had previously refused to reveal facility-specific case numbers during the public health crisis. The Idaho Statesman newspaper in Boise warned last week that it would sue the department if it continued to withhold the records. Normal: As the state prepares to ease some restrictions designed to limit the spread of the coronavirus, an Illinois State University professor who has been developing models of the pandemic since January is urging caution. “Every model we look at agrees on one thing … it is too soon to remove the lockdown measures,” said Olcay Akman, who also serves as editor in chief of Letters in Biomathematics. The peer-reviewed journal publishes mathematics and statistics research related to biological, ecological, medical and environmental settings. The rates may differ, he said. For example, his model forecasts 170,000 coronavirus-related deaths nationwide by August; the Centers for Disease Control forecasts 147,000. Both agree on the value of restrictive measures, said Akman. “Illinois is one of the better states,” Akman said, noting that it took action, such as closing schools, more quickly than some states. “I think we’ll reap the benefit.” Indianapolis: Modified school days, more outdoor class time, mask-wearing, and health screenings for students and staff are among steps schools should consider before reopening from coronavirus closures under recommendations released Friday by the state Department of Education. All schools across the state closed in mid-March and shifted largely to online coursework. The guidelines are not mandatory, however, and the state is leaving the ultimate decision on resuming classes, sports and other activities to local schools. Specific social distancing recommendations outlined in the report include scheduling groups of students to attend in-person school on alternate days or half-days to minimize the number of students in school buildings. The education department also suggests keeping the same students and staff members together as much as possible and increasing space between student desks. Des Moines: State health officials are reporting five more deaths linked to the coronavirus outbreak and 151 new cases of the disease caused by the virus. The Iowa Department of Public Health said Sunday that 602 people have died with COVID-19 in the state, and 21,589 cases of the virus have been confirmed in the state since the outbreak began. Nearly half of Iowa’s coronavirus cases are located in four counties: Polk, Woodbury, Black Hawk and Buena Vista. State officials report that 12,764 of the 21,589 people who tested positive for the virus have recovered from their illness. The total number of people tested is 187,341. Topeka: Gov. Laura Kelly said Friday that her administration will consider using part of the state’s share of federal coronavirus relief funds to help people struggling to pay their rents or home mortgages because of economic problems tied to the pandemic. Kelly defended a May 26 decision to rescind an executive order that had banned landlords from pursuing new evictions or lenders from starting to foreclose on home mortgages. She said she had to lift the order because keeping it in place would have stressed lenders and businesses that rent homes and apartments. The governor rescinded the order as she lifted all statewide restrictions on businesses and left it to the state’s 105 counties to determine their own rules for checking the spread of the new coronavirus. “I want struggling Kansans to know that I understand how you feel and how fearful you remain for your future,” Kelly said, calling such a program “a top priority” during a Statehouse news conference. Louisville: Gov. Andy Beshear announced Saturday that the state has 319 newly confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus, 65% of which are from Jefferson County. Four new deaths were also reported, according to Beshear. Kentucky now has seen at least 11,287 cases of COVID-19 and 470 deaths. “The virus is still out there. I know we’re tired. I know we all just want to have a normal summer,” Beshear said. “But we’ve already saved so many lives as Team Kentucky, and we can’t let up now.” Meanwhile, in order to further limit the spread of COVID-19, Baptist Health Louisville is now requiring all patients, family members, visitors, staff and vendors to wear a face mask at all times when inside its facilities. “Since people can spread the virus before symptoms start, or even if they never have symptoms, wearing a face mask is one of the most practical ways to reduce the spread,” Baptist Health Louisville President Larry Gray said Friday in a news release. New Orleans: Some businesses were slammed from the minute they reopened Friday after a 2 1/2-month COVID-19 pandemic closure, while others waited for their first customers or even took another week to prepare. Bars, massage facilities, bowling alleys, recreational pools and tattoo shops in the state were allowed to reopen under an order signed Thursday by Gov. John Bel Edwards. Restaurants and other businesses that had been allowed to open in mid-May at 25% of capacity were allowed to expand to half-capacity Friday. The new rules will be in effect for at least three weeks, Edwards said. New Orleans, the state’s original outbreak hot spot, isn’t participating in the wider reopening. More time and data is needed to decide when that is safe, city officials said. Portland: The most densely populated part of the city has the highest incidence of the coronavirus, and there’s a high rate of infection in neighboring communities as well, according to the Maine Center for Disease Control. Maine is the last state in New England to release local data about the virus. It had previously made only county-level information available. Lewiston had the largest total number of cases per ZIP code, with 203 positive tests for the virus, which came as no surprise to city officials. “We have long believed cases would be higher in Lewiston because of our dense neighborhoods and the regular travel between southern Maine,” Mayor Mark Cayer told the Sun Journal. The highest infection rates per capita were mostly in urban areas, with the exception of Medway, the Portland Press Herald reports. The Penobscot County community of 13,500 had 12 cases, ranking second per capita. Baltimore: The city on Monday will ease some stay-at-home directives prompted by the coronavirus pandemic. Mayor Bernard C. “Jack” Young on Friday announced the restrictions will be lifted after the city experienced a 14-day drop in the number of new cases and deaths. But he warned that the directives could be imposed again if certain criteria are met, including a five-day increase in new cases. Starting Monday, barbershops and hair salons will be allowed to offer services by appointment only and host up to five people per 1,000 square feet. The city will also waive fees for tent permits to allow houses of worship to host services for up to 50 people outdoors. Child care providers and camps will be allowed to operate on a limited basis. Hotels and construction sites will be able to reopen if they put appropriate safeguards in place, while nonessential retailers will be allowed to offer curbside and delivery services. Restaurants can provide outside dining. Boston: Diners will be able to eat outside Monday, and retail stores, day camps and day care centers will be allowed to resume operations, during the next phase of loosening restrictions imposed to slow the spread of the coronavirus, Gov. Charlie Baker announced. “Thanks to your hard work and your sacrifices, we’re bringing the fight to the virus, we’re moving forward, and Massachusetts is continuing to reopen,” Baker said Saturday at the Statehouse. There will be strict requirements for masks and social distancing for businesses that reopen Monday. Indoor dining will be remain off limits, Baker said. Day camps and child care facilities can open, but not overnight camps, Baker said. And hotels and motels will be allowed to accept all guests, not just essential workers, he said. Baker said he’s comfortable with moving forward with reopening the economy because the state has recorded a fall in the number of new cases and hospitalizations. Detroit: The state Supreme Court on Friday overturned orders that directed a barber to close his shop during the coronavirus pandemic, with one justice saying judges need to follow the “rule of law, not hysteria.” The Michigan appeals court made mistakes in telling a local judge to shut down Karl Manke’s shop in Owosso, 40 miles northeast of Lansing, the Supreme Court said. On May 4, Manke stopped complying with Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s order to keep barbershops and salons closed to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. In response, the state suspended his licenses. It also got a preliminary injunction from the appeals court. But Justice David Viviano said the 2-1 injunction needed to be unanimous under Michigan court rules. In addition, he said there should have been a full briefing and oral arguments. St. Paul: Gov. Tim Walz announced Friday a gradual reopening of indoor dining, gyms and entertainment venues during the coronavirus pandemic. Walz said the restrictions will loosen next Wednesday, but customers and employees still will be either strongly recommended or required to wear masks to help prevent the spread of COVID-19. In a statement, Walz said the state is “now in a position to carefully turn the dial toward reopening society.” Restaurants can offer indoor dining while maintaining social distancing, requiring reservations and seating no more than 50% occupancy. Gyms, yoga studios, theaters, concert halls, bowling alleys and museums may open at 25% occupancy. Places of worship can increase their occupancy to 50%. Minnesota Chamber President Doug Loon said businesses across the state welcome the progress. But Loon urged the Democratic governor to accelerate the process and reopen all Minnesota businesses by June 19. Batesville: A city-owned arena became a courtroom last week for the first felony criminal jury trial in Mississippi since the start of the coronavirus pandemic. More than 100 prospective jurors answered their summons to appear in court at the Civic Center on June 1, Panola County Circuit Clerk Melissa Meek-Phelps said in a news release. Prospective jurors maintained social distancing by sitting with five empty seats between them and alternating empty rows. County personnel took temperatures of visitors as they arrived at the arena. Hand sanitizer and masks were provided for people entering the building. Anyone who was ill, had health conditions that could put them at risk for COVID-19, was over age 65, was a caregiver or had recently performed jury service was excused. Kansas City: Confirmed coronavirus cases are on the rise in the state, with triple-digit increases for three straight days last week in the Kansas City metropolitan areas, according to state health department data. The 290 new cases reported Thursday amount to the biggest single-day increase in Missouri since May 4, and the average number of new cases has been steadily increasing during the past three weeks, The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. Missouri reported another 196 new cases Friday, raising the total to 14,253. At least 799 people have died, an increase of 13 from Thursday. The number of new cases had been dropping since May 7, with a low of 135 on May 17, before the increase in positive test results resumed. Missouri’s top health official, Dr. Randall Williams, said that improved testing capacity of up to 12,000 tests a day might partly account for the increase but that other factors could be involved. Helena: A man in his 60s has died from COVID-19, the Big Horn County health department said Friday. The state announced two new cases of COVID-19 from more than 1,200 tests performed Thursday. Both involve men in their 50s from Lewis and Clark County, which had not had a new case in eight weeks. Officials suspect one of the men contracted the disease from someone in Idaho and the other from a resident of another Montana county, county health officer Drenda Niemann told the Independent Record. In Gallatin County, health officer Matt Kelley said the eight new cases confirmed Wednesday were an indication of community spread but did not qualify as a reason to reimpose any restrictions on businesses or people’s activities. “It is reasonable to expect this trend to continue as Yellowstone National Park opens and more people come to the county from all over the nation,” he said, the Bozeman Daily Chronicle reports. Omaha: More employees in the state’s prison system have tested positive for COVID-19, as official figures show the overall number of cases in the state surpassing 15,000. A news release Friday from the Nebraska Department of Correctional Services said two more state prisons employees tested positive last week for the virus, bringing the systemwide total to 18. One of the two new cases is a staff member at the state prison at Tecumseh. The second was attending a staff training academy. The department said it will notify others at both locations about the new cases. Department officials also are directing anyone who may have had close contact with the infected staff members to self-quarantine until they are cleared by a medical provider. Carson City: Fire officials preparing for a hazardous wildfire season in the state will be challenged by high temperatures, drought and the coronavirus. “Fire doesn’t really care that there’s a pandemic. We’re going to have to do our job, but we can minimize the risk,” Reno Fire Department Chief Dave Cochran said at a 2020 Fire Season Outlook conference Wednesday. Cochran, who also serves as Nevada Fire Chiefs Association president, said departments were aware that the virus could spread through their ranks. Firefighters in his department have already contracted it, he said, declining to provide additional details due to privacy concerns. Due to the nature of their work, firefighters can’t always adhere to CDC guidelines on face coverings and social distancing when deployed, Cochran said. But his departments and others throughout Nevada are adopting new protocols. Concord: Beaches are open again to sunbathers, and a lawsuit challenging the governor’s spending authority during the coronavirus pandemic is back on the docket. Restaurants can resume indoor dining June 15, but capacity will be limited in the four counties that have been hardest hit by the coronavirus, Gov. Chris Sununu said Friday. After being restricted to outdoor dining since May 18, restaurants will be allowed to offer indoor dining at tables spread 6 feet apart. Those in Rockingham, Hillsborough, Merrimack and Strafford counties will be limited to 50% capacity, however. The rules also apply to large, catered events such as wedding receptions, which will be limited to 50% of a venue’s capacity statewide. Though he joked about banning the Funky Chicken and the Macarena, Sununu said dancing will be permitted: “We are strongly discouraging it ... but I’m not gonna be the guy in Footloose who says, ‘No dancing in my town.’ ” Trenton: The state’s motor vehicle offices will open June 15, and road testing and the issuance of new licenses can resume from the COVID-19 pause June 29, Gov. Phil Murphy said Friday. It’s the latest sector of the state’s economy to move toward reopening, following announcements on nonessential retail, salons, barbershops and outdoor dining, which will also resume June 15. Murphy also signed an extension of the state’s public health emergency order, which will remain in place for another month. Such orders expire automatically after 30 days. The renewed order means only that the state will continue to carry authority to act if the outbreak worsens again, Murphy said, but it does not mean the state will now halt reopening. Las Cruces: The City Council has moved to ditch a proposed mandate backed up by misdemeanor penalties and instead will consider a resolution encouraging people to wear face coverings in retail and commercial businesses to help combat the spread of the coronavirus. City officials said the council tabled the proposed ordinance Friday in favor of holding a special meeting Monday afternoon to consider the resolution. The now-shelved ordinance would have generally required wearing masks or other face coverings with exceptions for eating, drinking and under certain other circumstances. Violations would have been a misdemeanor carrying a fine up to $500 and up to 90 days in jail. According to a statement released by the city Friday, the council “prefers voluntary compliance over enforcement and does not want the effort to be punitive.” Albany: “Socially distanced” outdoor graduation ceremonies with up to 150 people will be allowed beginning June 26 as coronavirus pandemic restrictions continue to be loosened, Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced Sunday. There were 45 coronavirus-related deaths in the state Saturday, up slightly from 35 on Friday but down from a peak of more than 700 per day in April. Cuomo pointed to low numbers of positive tests in saying the state had successfully “bent the curve.” Meanwhile, New York City will enter the first phase of reopening Monday, with the rest of the state either already in or about to enter the second phase. Cuomo urged protesters who have been demonstrating against police brutality and racism to get tested, saying 15 sites would be dedicated to that so people could get results quickly. “I would act as if you were exposed, and I would tell people you are interacting with, ‘Assume I am positive for the virus,’ ” Cuomo said. Durham: A young girl has died after a battle with the coronavirus. WRAL reports that Aurea Soto Morales died Monday after she was hospitalized for complications from COVID-19. The second grader from Durham had started feeling sick in late May and was rushed to the hospital after having a seizure. Relatives said her brain swelled before she went into a coma and eventually died. Family members said they want to spread the message that children are not immune to the virus and that people should take the pandemic seriously. “It just went down so quickly, and I didn’t even get to say goodbye to her,” said her sister Jennifer Jano Morales. “She liked being the boss of herself. She was very confident of herself. Every time we would take a picture, she would always strike a pose.” The girl’s elementary school principal, Victoria Creamer, said in a statement that Aurea was “a shining light wherever she went.” Bismarck: Gov. Doug Burgum announced Friday that he’s easing restrictions on visitation at long-term care facilities that were put in place because of the coronavirus. Visitation to skilled nursing, basic care and assisted living facilities was suspended by executive order April 6. The amended order bases visiting rules on the prevalence of COVID-19 cases in the county and the number of active cases among residents. More than 40 facilities have been approved to begin the first phase of the plan, which includes group dining and activities such as bingo. In 14 days, if another round of testing shows no new active positives, they can begin indoor visitation. Starting immediately, the state is encouraging outdoor visitation by appointment, with appropriate social distancing and personal protective equipment, including masks. “We know the stress and strain of isolation is real,” Burgum said. Columbus: Casinos, amusement parks and racetracks will be allowed to open June 19, Gov. Mike DeWine announced during a briefing Friday as he responded to criticism of the state’s measured reopening plan. In addition, the annual Memorial golf tournament in the Columbus suburb of Dublin was approved to take place in mid-July. Outdoor theaters in the state also will be allowed to reopen, DeWine said, once they submit a plan as other businesses have done. “Early on I said we are not shutting down; we’re waking up,” Dr. Amy Acton, the state health director, said at the briefing. ”As we’re reopening, we’re also waking up. We have to be more intentional than we’ve ever been.” DeWine also touched on the criticism he has received for his cautious approach to reopening the state amid the coronavirus pandemic. “To those who say we should open Ohio with no restrictions, my answer to that is to do that in the midst of this pandemic makes absolutely no sense,” he said. Oklahoma City: The number of Oklahomans who have died after contracting the coronavirus is nearly at 350 after state health officials Sunday reported another death and more than 90 new cases. At least 7,150 people in Oklahoma have now tested positive for the virus, according to the State Department of Health. At least 348 people have died. Overall, new cases had been on a downward trend the past two weeks in the state. The true numbers are likely higher because many people have not been tested, and studies suggest people can be infected and not feel sick. Salem: Multnomah County officials submitted reopening framework to Gov. Kate Brown’s office Friday in the hope of beginning the first phase of the state’s plan to ease COVID-19 restrictions. If approved, restaurants in the county on Friday could once again offer dine-in service, gyms could open, personal services would be available by appointment, and the gathering size would increase from 10 people to 25. Multnomah, which is state’s most populous county, is the only county in Oregon that has not yet entered the first phase. “We have moved thoughtfully and deliberately to this day so that the sacrifices our communities have made since March will not be lost,” said Multnomah County Commission Chair Deborah Kafoury. The county has taken a slower and more deliberative approach to reopening during the pandemic due to size, density, diversity and health care capacity. Philadelphia: A federal judge has approved a consent order requiring better access to soap, face masks and cleaning supplies to settle a portion of a lawsuit brought against the city seeking better coronavirus protections and improvements of other conditions for prisoners in the city’s jails. The consent order comes as the city announced it had completed about two weeks of testing all of the more than 3,800 asymptomatic prisoners housed in its jails for coronavirus, ultimately finding 223 positive cases. The city said the jails will move into their own yellow phase in the coming weeks as a result – meaning lockdown conditions will be eased, and prisoners will start to be allowed to leave their cells for more activities. The consent decree will require the city’s prison department to provide increased access to hygiene products by giving inmates free soap, clean towels, daily showers, access to cleaning products and four face masks each. Providence: Gov. Gina Raimondo on Friday extended a state of emergency and several other of her coronavirus-related executive orders for an additional month to prevent a resurgence of the disease. The state of emergency, which originally took effect March 9, was extended until July 5 so Rhode Island can remain eligible for federal resources, she said. “It just gives us the flexibility that we need in my administration to move quickly in order to make sure we meet the needs of the crisis,” she said. The order requiring everyone to wear face coverings while in public places when proper social distancing cannot be maintained was extended until July 4, the Democrat said at her daily news briefing. There are exemptions for very young children and people who for medical reasons cannot wear a mask. Chesterfield: The sheriff and chief deputy in one rural county both have tested positive for COVID-19. Chesterfield County Sheriff James Dixon and Chief Deputy Chris Page will not return to the office for at least 14 days and until they are cleared by doctors, the sheriff’s office said in a statement. Also, health workers are tracing anyone who came in extended contact with the men to encourage them to be tested. The sheriff’s office also is cleaning its office, all equipment and vehicles. Both Dixon and Rose said they got tested because they had symptoms of the coronavirus. South Carolina has seen a spike in cases in the past two weeks. The state saw a record 512 new cases Saturday to bring the total COVID-19 case count to more than 13,900, according to the state Department of Health and Environmental Control. Also Saturday, seven additional deaths were reported, bringing the COVID-19 death toll to at least 545 people. Sioux Falls: The state has dropped plans to test an anti-malaria drug to prevent COVID-19, the partners in the study said Friday. The statewide tests were called off after a University of Minnesota study found that the drug hydroxychloroquine had no benefit over a placebo as a way to prevent COVID-19 in people exposed to the coronavirus. The drug hydroxychloroquine has attracted controversy after President Donald Trump promoted it as an antidote to COVID-19, but it was shown in studies not to help and even to be harmful to people hospitalized by the virus. Sanford Health, Avera Health and Monument Health were collaborating on the tests, which were sponsored by the state of South Dakota. Gov. Kristi Noem said last month the state was going ahead with plans to test small amounts of the drug. The South Dakota trial was in the early stages and had just recently opened for enrollment. Nashville: State officials on Friday sought an appeal and an immediate pause to a court’s ruling last week that makes all of the state’s 4.1 million registered voters eligible to vote by mail during to the coronavirus pandemic. The state attorney general’s office filed the request in Davidson County Chancery Court to appeal and stay that court’s temporary injunction that expanded absentee eligibility Thursday. The state argued the ruling will impose a hefty financial burden on the state and counties, put election integrity at risk with the quick turnaround, and create further voter confusion. “Indeed, in the immediate wake of the June 4 injunction, voters are already reaching out to county election offices seeking guidance about absentee voting,” the state’s filing says. “But what happens if a voter applies for an absentee ballot based upon fear of COVID-19 and the temporary injunction that permits such an application is later reversed?” Houston: Health officials said Friday that they are investigating an outbreak of the COVID-19 virus at a suburban Houston health care facility that has been quarantined after 14 deaths were reported. Harris County Public Health began investigating the outbreak April 21 after two people tested positive for the new coronavirus at the Oakmont Healthcare and Rehabilitation Center of Humble. The facility provides short-stay rehabilitation and long-term and hospice care to older patients. It looked like things were improving, but then officials learned that conditions had deteriorated and that COVID-19-related deaths and cases weren’t being quickly reported, said Dr. Umair Shah, the health department’s executive director. Officials weren’t told of eight of the 14 deaths until after May 27, Shah said. The facility had also failed to implement protocols and create a plan to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, Shah said. Salt Lake City: The state reported its largest single-day increase in the number of COVID-19 cases Friday, with many of those coming in connection with an outbreak at a meatpacking plant in northern Utah. Health officials are investigating the “ongoing outbreak” at the unnamed facility in the Bear River Health District, which covers Cache, Rich and Box Elder counties. One-third of the 439 cases reported Friday came from that area, and many of those are linked to the facility. “I expect to see additional cases of COVID-19 identified as part of this outbreak, both at the worksite and in the community,” Utah State Epidemiologist Angela Dunn said in a statement. “Many of the workers at this facility match the demographics of who we know are at the highest risk for infection.” Protecting workers can be especially challenging at plants that typically employ thousands of people who often work side-by-side carving meat, making social distancing all but impossible. Winooski: State health officials said Friday that they are expecting more positive cases of the novel coronavirus as testing continues in the city, where 34 cases have been confirmed. Speaking alongside city officials, Health Commissioner Dr. Mark Levine said Friday that 93 lab tests remain pending, and additional tests are being conducted. “Really, the only way to stop an outbreak is to do it together,” Levine said during an outdoor news conference in Winooski. “Every single person is needed to keep this disease from spreading.” Vermont has had a low number of new virus cases, and while the 34 new cases reported Thursday was the largest-single day increase in weeks, health officials have been expecting outbreaks. Winooski, with a population of about 7,300 in 1.4 square miles, is considered one of Vermont’s most diverse and densely populated communities, and it’s home to many non-English speakers. Roanoke: As much of the state prepares to enter the second phase of reopening, a local movie screen manufacturer is poised to help businesses take precautions. Officials at Harkness Screens, wanting to help and also to preserve jobs, decided to shift gears and began making protective barriers, including freestanding screens encased in sturdy frames and floating screens that hang from the ceiling and can be used at service counters. Anthony Kelly, the company’s senior vice president for the Americas, said the company’s materials and processes were well-suited for making the products. “We see the protective barriers as being a key product in the short term to hopefully help with reopening, including movie theaters, but then also get back to what we’ve done for 90 years as well,” he said. The barriers could be useful in a number of environments, he said, including restaurants, offices, government buildings, factories and food processing plants. Olympia: State officials announced Friday that seven counties have been approved to move to the third phase of the state’s four-stage reopening plan that eases COVID-19 restrictions and allows businesses to start to reopen, and six more counties have been approved to move to the second phase. King County – the state’s largest and home to Seattle – was approved to move to a modified Phase 1 and will now allow all outdoor recreation permitted in Phase 2, expand opening indoor fitness studios for one-on-one activities, allow restaurants to begin opening indoor seating at 25% of normal capacity, and allow hair stylists and other personal services at 25% capacity. Clark, Okanogan, Pierce, Skagit, Snohomish and Whatcom counties were approved to move to a full Phase 2, which allows restaurants and taverns to reopen at half-capacity with limited table sizes, hair and nail salons and barbershops to resume business, and retail stores to reopen for in-store purchases at 30% capacity. It also allows additional outdoor recreation and gatherings with no more than five people outside of a person’s household. Charleston: West Virginia University will require testing of all students, faculty and staff for the coronavirus before they can return to campus for the start of fall classes, the university announced last week. Students must wear masks on campus, including in class, when the fall semester begins Aug. 19, the university said in a news release. Students will go home for Thanksgiving and finish the semester’s classes online, the university said. The move is seen as a crucial step toward launching football and other fall sports. “We have given careful consideration to the wisdom of returning to campus while the COVID-19 pandemic is still with us,” West Virginia President Gordon Gee said in a statement. “However, it is clear our students want to be with their professors and fellow Mountaineers. We are taking every precaution and making every preparation possible so they can do that safely.” Faculty, staff and students must complete a coronavirus education course before Aug. 11, the statement said. Milwaukee: State health officials on Saturday reported 322 new cases of the coronavirus, a number that continued a downward trend of positive tests by percentage of total tests within a 14-day period. The update included 12 new deaths, increasing the total number to 645. The cumulative number of positive cases stands at nearly 20,600. The number of recovered cases has increased from 66% to 67%. Health officials said they have met four of six established criteria meant to help determine when they can “safely open Wisconsin.” Nearly 300 people in Milwaukee County have died after contracting the coronavirus, according to data from that county. Cheyenne: State agencies must immediately cut spending and prepare for even deeper cuts while the state faces an unprecedented hit to revenue, Gov. Mark Gordon said last week. With more than a third of state revenue expected to vanish, agencies should prepare for a 20% spending reduction, Gordon said in a news conference Thursday. Even so, he said, spending cuts won’t be enough, and the state will need to look at tapping savings and finding new and/or additional revenue to patch up the budget. Meanwhile, the coronavirus has cost Wyoming the luxury of time to finally address years of gradually dwindling revenue, Gordon said. “Our time is now,” he said. Wyoming faces an up to $1.5 billion revenue drop over the next two years because of coronavirus-related fiscal woes. From USA TODAY Network and wire reports"
65,65,"Masks, temperature checks, empty rows: Post-coronavirus concerts could look very differentGary Dinges ","May 28, 2020",https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/2020/05/01/coronavirus-when-concerts-return-expect-much-different-experience/3055806001/,"Artists are starting to test the waters of live music in a coronavirus world. But already, fallout from the pandemic is making for a dramatically different concert experience.  Earlier this month, Travis McCready of blues-rock band Bishop Gunn threw what Rolling Stone dubbed ""America's first pandemic concert"" in Fort Smith, Arkansas. Venue TempleLive welcomed 200 fans – reduced from its usual capacity of 1,000 – who were required to wear masks and sit in assigned seats blocked off from other groups of people to allow for social distancing. Temperature checks and hand sanitizer stations greeted concertgoers before they walked through the doors, and no more than 10 people were allowed into restrooms at a time.  A few days before that, Keith Urban played a secret drive-in concert outside Nashville for 200 health care workers who watched and listened from their cars, with more artists plotting similar events this summer. And Collin Raye just announced a free outdoor concert in Kaysville, Utah, on May 30 that defies the state's ban on gatherings of more than 50 people, but will utilize ""recommended sensible safety precautions,"" the country singer said in a statement. But even with these new measures in place, there's serious doubt among some insiders that live music will fully return before 2021. A shortage of tests and the lack of a vaccine simply make things too risky, says Travis Rieder, assistant director of education initiatives and research scholar at the Johns Hopkins Berman Institute of Bioethics. ""Attending a Beyonce concert? I can't imagine that happening until we have a vaccine,"" Rieder told USA TODAY. ""The risk of those events as we would have done them in the past outweighs the benefit of doing them. We are flexible creatures. We're going to have to do things differently. We can find ways to do the things we love."" Staying Apart, Together:A newsletter about how to cope with the coronavirus pandemic Ticket refund?Unless your concert has been canceled amid the coronavirus, they can be hard to come by Venues used by big-name touring acts such as Bon Jovi, Foo Fighters and the Jonas Brothers often seat more than 20,000 people. That makes contact tracing, should an attendee report having coronavirus, virtually impossible, Rieder says. While elected officials have said science should be the primary decider on when life returns to normal, Rieder says it's not that easy. ""This is really hard,"" he says. ""We're hearing a lot today that this is a science question. We think that's only partially true. It's an admirable answer, but it's really about trading off values. ""We want decision-makers to really think through what are the benefits and burdens under each set of policies."" Right now, music industry professionals across the nation – bookers, promoters, security personnel, venue executives – are huddling, attempting to come up with best practices to get performers back on stage. Whenever that happens, music lovers should be ready for big changes, says Karly Tuckness, co-founder of Four Leaf Productions, a firm started this year by veterans of C3 Presents, the company behind Lollapalooza and Austin City Limits Music Festival. Among the precautions she predicts ""in the short term"" are hand-washing and sanitizer stations,  a requirement that attendees wear masks and temperature checks at gates. ""Some of these things may become the new normal, some may phase out over time,"" Tuckness says. Children's music is booming:Amid coronavirus pandemic, streams see double-digit increase The solution will differ depending on the type of event, according to Scott Davidson, president of Code 4 Event Management and Emergency Services, a firm that works with a broad range of organizers. ""A tightly controlled movie night in the park has a very different epidemiological risk profile than an EDM music festival in the same location,"" he says. At some events, guests may be asked to register to help with contact tracing efforts.  Davidson plans for additional safety training for venue staff and educational signage for patrons.  Want a classical music performance for your grandparents at home?Vanderbilt students can help When it comes to creating six feet of space between attendees, things get a little more difficult, Tuckness says. ""While our industry is nimble and responsive, physical distancing may be hard to achieve at a large music event,"" she says. Venues could keep seats or rows open to create space between people. Or they could reduce capacity ""to help spread people out while still achieving the collective experience attendees crave,"" she says. The safety and sanitation lessons learned as a result of the coronavirus will come in handy when it comes to preparing for what the future may hold, Davidson says. ""Just as we did after (the) terrorist attacks of 9/11, we must continue to apply these lessons learned to enhance our preparedness for the next threat to our industry and community,"" he says. Kevin Lyman, who founded the Vans Warped Tour in 1995, has seen a lot during his time in the industry. He says the pandemic could lead a number of performers and festivals to go online. One of his events, the 320 Festival featuring performers such as Social House and Lindsey Stirling, had been set to take place in Los Angeles but was livestreamed instead. ""We were on such a treadmill of touring, and I think some of the online ideas were always an afterthought and not given much attention,"" he says. ""However, this was such a shock to the whole ecosystem of the business. It is now opening many opportunities to explore this medium."" Pandemic pastimes:100 things to do while stuck inside Most people will still crave the live experience, Lyman says, but he predicts watching online could be the new norm for as many as 10% of concertgoers. ""I believe that some are carving out a niche and will prosper post-COVID-19,"" he says. While making larger venues safe has been a focus for many, owners of smaller live music venues are struggling, too. In Milwaukee, Linneman’s Riverwest Innremains closed and owner Jim Linneman isn't sure when it will reopen. Whenever that is, he knows big changes are ahead. ""Bars and live music venues like mine require people to survive,"" he says. ""Unfortunately, people are the host, or carriers, of this awful virus. So nightclubs must adapt until the vaccine or cure is found."" Linneman says temperature checks are likely at the door, as well as hand sanitizer stations. At the bar, he plans to install plexiglass to protect bartenders. Some bar stools will be removed to create distance. Waitstaff will wear gloves and masks, and drinkware will likely be disposable plastic instead of glass. He plans to install equipment to stream shows as well, catering to those unwilling to venture out but still willing to pay to see musicians perform. ""Live music has always been some of the best entertainment you can lay your eyes on,"" he says. ""We believe worries of the virus may be around for some time, so we decided to install a multi-camera livestreaming setup so those who are still worried can watch and listen to the show from the comfort of home."" From 'Queen Eye' to 'Gilmore':10 happy, joyful, funny TV shows to watch to escape the coronavirus news Performers who play smaller venues are feeling the pinch, Lyman says. That's because up to 70% of their earnings come from touring. ""It is the working band that is suffering since they depend on the majority of their income from the road,"" he says. ""In talking to people at management companies, it has become very apparent how important the road is for their artists. To have that (income) vanish overnight was a real shock.""   Even when restrictions, some Americans may not want to leave home, according to a recent survey.  Performance Research polled 1,000 people and found 44% of respondents said they planned to attend fewer events. Indoor events were a concern for more folks than outdoor events, the survey found. Allison Wollam of Houston has tickets to two concerts that have been rescheduled, but she's not sure if she'll attend. ""I probably won't go to concerts until we see a significant drop in cases of COVID-19 and medical experts give the green light, even if concerts resume,"" she says. ""I don't think it would be too much fun to attend a concert while practicing social distancing and wearing a mask."" Wollam's father has cancer, so she's been especially cautious during the coronavirus pandemic, in case she's called upon to help him. That's made her look at the concert experience from a different perspective.  'Absolutely miserable':Kristen Bell on homeschooling amid coronavirus quarantine ""I used to love standing down in front at concerts and singing along with everyone, but now that doesn't seem appealing at all,"" she says. Those in the music industry know a lot of folks have opinions similar to those held by Wollam, but they anticipate it will only be an issue temporarily. ""I think we’re desperate to get back out there, to have shared experiences that move us,"" Tuckness says. ""That’s why you see people on their balconies playing music or singing together. ""Music is best shared with others. You can’t deny the power of seeing a performance live, hearing thousands of people sing together or break out into dance and that magnetic energy that is unique to coming together, in person.""

66,66,"Officials blame 'out-of-state' agitators but those at the heart of protests are homegrownBrett Murphy, Josh Salman and Dak Le ","Jun. 2, 2020",https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/investigations/2020/05/31/george-floyd-protest-agitators-mostly-homegrown-not-outsiders/5300362002/,"Rioters broke into the Minneapolis Police 3rd Precinct just after 10 p.m. Thursday night and set the building on fire. They tossed fireworks into the blaze. Chants of ""George Floyd"" and ""I can't breathe"" echoed from below the smoke and bright explosions while hundreds gathered to record the moment on their cellphones.  Gov. Tim Walz responded by calling in the largest national National Guard deployment in state history, the first of dozens of police escalations around the country responding to eruptions of outrage over the weekend after Floyd, an unarmed black man, died during an arrest by white police officers in Minneapolis on May 25.  By Saturday, local politicians were casting the chaos as the handiwork of outside agitators. Walz estimated that about 80% of those being destructive do not live in the state. The mayor of St. Paul, Melvin Carter, said every person arrested in the city Friday night was not a Minnesotan, a sentiment parroted by Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey. “I want to be very, very clear: The people that are doing this are not Minneapolis residents,” Frey added. “They are coming in largely from outside of the city, from outside of the region, to prey on everything we have built over the last several decades.” The narrative offers a simple, tidy explanation for violence that allows politicians to simultaneously support the ethos of the movement and the police officers trying to keep the peace. But it’s not true. The overwhelming majority of people who posted on social media from the precinct fire and those arrested Friday night at the protests in the Twin Cities live in the area, according to USA TODAY's review of police jail records and almost 100,000 tweets.  In an analysis of more than 1,800 Twitter users who posted from within a 3-mile radius of the precinct fire on Thursday, 85% had a history of posting inside the greater Minneapolis area before George Floyd’s death. The data – which represent only a fraction of protesters and could include some people who were not directly involved – indicate most live or work nearby, not out of state. “The 3rd precinct fell today,” one user tweeted just after midnight Friday morning. ""All power to the youth. All power to the people. Justice for George Floyd and all victims of police murder and brutality.”  Another posted a picture of the blaze with the caption: “Chants of #BlackLivesMatter as the minneapolis police precinct burns down.” USA TODAY’s social media analysis, supported by arrest records, offers a window into where protesters at the epicenter of the movement actually came from, dispelling many of the claims and talking points.  St. Paul police logs show two-thirds of those arrested for looting and property destruction connected to the protests are from Minnesota. And the Minneapolis logs show 93 of the 109 people arrested in the city between Thursday night and Saturday morning reside in-state. Across the country, where peaceful protests devolved into looting, vandalism and arson — as well as violent displays of police aggression — USA TODAY found the same pattern.  For instance, all but three of the 144 people arrested Friday and Saturday in Detroit were from Michigan. On Saturday, 28 people were arrested in Nashville. Most were from the city and all but three were from Tennessee. Five of the six people arrested at Friday night's downtown protests in Louisville, Kentucky, live in Louisville. The other did not immediately give police her address.  In Los Angeles, where a stunning 533 people were arrested during Friday’s protests, police spokeswoman Capt. Gisselle Espinoza said her department has no reason to believe they came from far away. The city did not provide a roster of those arrested or a breakdown of their home addresses.    In response to the public records collected by USA TODAY and local news reports, Minnesota officials have begun walking back their statements.  ""The Mayor went with the information he had at the time and learned after the media conference more than half are from Minnesota,"" Carter's communications director, Peter Leggett, said in a statement to USA TODAY. At a press conference Sunday, Walz backpedaled and said he ""certainly wanted to believe"" the majority of agitators are from out of town but because it is hard to get data from arrests, the state is relying on what he called human intelligence. ""We cannot provide more intelligence on an ongoing law enforcement matter,"" Walz's spokesman, Sebastian Kitchen, told USA TODAY.  Frey’s office did not immediately respond to questions about evidence to support the claims or how they are contradicted by the social media data and police records.  But by then, the narrative had caught national steam, spreading to local officials in other cities and the White House.  ""80% of the RIOTERS in Minneapolis last night were from OUT OF STATE,"" President Donald Trump tweeted Saturday afternoon. ""They are harming businesses (especially African American small businesses), homes and the community."" Viral social media posts and local leaders, as well as pundits in both conservative and progressive camps, blamed a conspiracy of outsiders infiltrating the protests to escalate violence.  Experts said the “outside agitator” trope, which also appeared in past Black Lives Matter movements, can unite local politicians looking to assign blame without taking a side.  “There is this very common idea in policing to attribute the violence to professional protestors who come from other places for the purposes of causing chaos,” said Edward Maguire, a professor of criminology at Arizona State University. “There are some people who do travel to protest and to some extent that does happen, but the idea is dramatically overblown.”  Police can then leverage the distinction as a pretense for a heavier response, some critics said. Amber Hamilton, a sociology Ph.D. candidate at the University of Minnesota, wrote that Minnesotans seem quick to accept the state’s narrative of outside destruction without real evidence that it’s true. “I’m afraid that that’ll lead people to accept uses of forces that they may not otherwise.”  Without evidence, city officials in Louisville on Saturday attributed a trail of vandalism to out-of-towners. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear announced he'd send the National Guard to the city.  At least 19 cities have followed suit and deployed military support since Friday. And more than 1,600 people have been arrested around the country since Thursday, according to the Associated Press.  “What we have seen, especially last night, and what our intelligence says is going to happen tonight are outside groups moving in, trying to create violence to harm everybody who is on those streets,"" Beshear said Saturday afternoon. Neither the mayor nor the governor immediately responded to questions about the evidence supporting those claims.  Emo Ismail, 17, was among those at the head of the crowd in Minneapolis Friday night as it faced off with police near the police precinct in flames. Ismail lives in Richfield, on the Minneapolis border, and said he often has run into young men he knew during the protests, including from neighborhood basketball games. “I do believe there were some people who came in to cause trouble and not to honor his (Lloyd’s) legacy,” he said. “Frankly, it’s disrespectful. But I can’t blame them – some of us channel our anger in different ways.” Mat Davis, a volunteer with Black Lives Matter in Indianapolis, said no outside people were invited to Saturday’s protest. He said the media is often quick to take the word from local and police officials instead of protest organizers.  “Then we are left with not only the damage control but a full-on smear campaign,” Davis said.  Some peaceful protesters say the violent actors meet a different definition of “outsider” that extends beyond where they live: They are often white and associated with anarchist, anti-facists – also known as antifa – or far-right extremist groups. “When you break it down it’s, antifa messing things up,” Daniel Diaz, a Rochester resident protesting in the city, said Saturday. “It's people from these suburbs. They’re coming over and they’re messing things up.”  In Detroit, USA TODAY Network video recorded a protester in a Hawaiian shirt, a rifle strapped to his back. An anti-government group that calls itself Boogaloo Bois has made plans online to show up at protests wearing Hawaiian shirts.  An outsized proportion of Detroit protesters appeared to be white in a predominantly black city. Local officials there rallied around protecting the city from those seeking to destroy it from the outside. The violence, they say, comes from the suburbs.  ""These outsiders put our community in harm's way,"" said Rev. Charles Williams, president of the Michigan Chapter of the National Action Network, speaking of suburbanites who joined Detroiters late Friday during a downtown stand-off with police. During a press conference Saturday, the Minnesota Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington once again raised the specter of outside influence. He said the state has begun tracing those who were arrested Friday night to unravel the larger “network” of criminals.  ""Who are they associated with? What platforms are they advocating for?"" Harrington said.

67,67,More than 100 Apple Stores reopening this weekJefferson Graham ,"May 26, 2020",https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2020/05/26/apple-stores-reopen-but-differently-you-may-not-able-enter/5260800002/,"Some Apple Stores will reopen this week, with 100 of the 271 U.S. outlets opening their doors again.  However, shopping won't resume like it used to do pre-coronavirus.  In most of the stores, customers won't be allowed to enter the premises, and instead will only be able to pick up products in front of the store or via a dedicated curbside location. Apple will be setting up Genius Bar appointments in front of the stores as well.  The Genius Bar is where customers go to get free tech support, or to have data moved from Apple devices.  However, some stores will allow customers to come in and shop, including locations in the San Diego and Santa Barbara areas in California, Las Vegas, Houston, Texas and Boca Raton, Florida.   Help:Apple and Google release coronavirus contact tracing technology for public health mobile apps Tech tips:How to set up your Apple Watch just the way you want by personalizing it, changing faces In a May 17 letter to consumers, Apple's retail chief Deirdre O’Brien said the new approach to retail ""may look and feel a little different. For one thing, you'll find yourself with plenty of space. ""In every store, we're focused on limiting occupancy and giving everybody lots of room."" Additionally, customers and employees will all be required to wear face coverings, and in the stores that will allow patrons to enter, they will need to have a temperature check first and to stand a good distance apart from others.

68,68,'The risks of getting it wrong are enormous.' Tech-assisted COVID-19 tracking is having some issues.Matt O'Brien ,"May 18, 2020",https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2020/05/18/coronavirus-tracking-tech-issues/5217928002/,"Harnessing today's technology to the task of fighting the coronavirus pandemic is turning out to be more complicated than it first appeared. The first U.S. states that rolled out smartphone apps for tracing the contacts of COVID-19 patients are dealing with technical glitches and a general lack of interest by their residents. A second wave of tech-assisted pandemic surveillance tools is on its way, this time with the imprimatur of tech giants Apple and Google. But those face their own issues, among them potential accuracy problems and the fact that they won't share any information with governments that could help track the spread of the illness. Contact tracing is a pillar of infection control. It's traditionally conducted by trained public health workers who interview those who may have been exposed, then urge them to get tested and isolate themselves. Some estimates call for as many as 300,000 U.S. workers to do the work effectively, but so far those efforts have lagged. Apple is reopening some stores this week:Expect to wear a mask, have temperature checked More:Apple, Google will warn you if you've been exposed to COVID-19. Here's how. Other tech companies like Salesforce have offered database tools to assist manual tracing efforts, although those also raise privacy concerns because of the need to collect and store detailed information about people's social connections, health status and whereabouts. Privacy advocates warn that the danger of creating new government surveillance powers for the pandemic could lead to much bigger problems in the future. In a new policy paper shared with The Associated Press, the American Civil Liberties Union is warning state governments to tread more carefully and establish stricter privacy procedures before deploying technology meant to detect and curb new coronavirus outbreaks. Even the most privacy-minded tools, such as those to be released soon by Apple and Google, require constraints so that they don't become instruments of surveillance or oppression. ""The risks of getting it wrong are enormous,"" said Neema Singh Guliani, a senior legislative counsel with the ACLU. ACLU's report says the worst location-tracking technology should be rejected outright, such as apps that track individual movements via satellite-based GPS technology and feed sensitive personal data into centralized government databases. ""Good designs don't require you to gather people's location information and store that,"" Singh Guliani said. She urged governments to set rules addressing both privacy and efficacy so that surveillance tools don't interfere with more conventional public health methods. Utah, North Dakota and South Dakota were the first U.S. states to launch voluntary phone apps that enable public health departments to track the location and connections of people who test positive for the coronavirus. But governors haven't had much luck getting the widespread participation needed for them to work effectively. The state with the highest known rate of participation so far is South Dakota, where last week about 2% of residents had the Care19 app on their phones. Last week was also the first time it recorded a single infection. The same app is getting even less support in North Dakota. ""This is a red state,"" said Crystal Wolfrum, a paralegal in Minot, North Dakota, who says she's one of the only people among her neighbors and friends to download the app. ""They don't want to wear masks. They don't want to be told what to do. A lot of people I talk to are, like, 'Nope, you're not going to track me.' "" Wolfrum said she's doubtful that the app will be useful, both because of people's wariness and its poor performance. She gave it a bad review on Google's app store after it failed to notice lengthy shopping trips she made one weekend to Walmart and Target stores. North Dakota is now looking at starting a second app based on the Apple-Google technology. ""It was rushed to market,"" because of the urgent need, Vern Dosch, the state's contact tracing facilitator, told KFYR-TV in Bismarck. ""We knew that it wouldn't be perfect."" The ACLU is taking a more measured approach to the Apple and Google method, which will use Bluetooth wireless technology to automatically notify people about potential COVID-19 exposure without revealing anyone's identity to the government. But even if the app is described as voluntary and personal health information never leaves the phone, the ACLU says it's important for governments to set additional safeguards to ensure that businesses and public agencies don't make showing the app a condition of access to jobs, public transit, grocery stores and other services. Among the governments experimenting with the Apple-Google approach are the state of Washington and several European countries. Swiss epidemiologist Marcel Salathé said all COVID-19 apps so far are ""fundamentally broken"" because they collect too much irrelevant information and don't work well with Android and iPhone operating software. Salathé authored a paper favoring the privacy-protecting approach that the tech giants have since adopted, and he considers it the best hope for a tool that could actually help isolate infected people before they show symptoms and spread the disease. ""You will remember your work colleagues but you will not remember the random person next to you on a train or really close to you at the bar,"" he said. Other U.S. governors are looking at technology designed to supplement manual contact-tracing efforts. As early as this week, Rhode Island has said it is set to launch a contact-tracing database system mostly built by software giant Salesforce, which has said it is also working with Massachusetts, California, Louisiana and New York City on a similar approach. Salesforce says it can use data-management software to help trained crews trace ""relationships across people, places and events"" and identify virus clusters down to the level of a neighborhood hardware store. It will rely on manual input of information gathered through conversations by phone, text or email. ""It's only as good as a lot of us using it,"" Democratic Gov. Gina Raimondo said at a news conference last week. ""If 10% of Rhode Island's population opts in, this won't be effective."" The state hasn't yet outlined what people are expected to opt into. The ACLU hasn't yet weighed in on the Salesforce model, but has urged contact-tracing public health departments to protect people from unnecessary disclosure of personal information and to not criminalize the requirement for self-isolation."
69,69,"Infected ferry, Crater Lake, mask-shaming, virtual farmers market: News from around our 50 statesFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports ","Jun. 9, 2020",https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/06/09/infected-ferry-crater-lake-mask-shaming-virtual-farmers-market-news-around-states/111939810/,"Gadsden:Drive-thru testing, with next-day results, will be offered from 1 p.m. to 5 p.m. Wednesday in the outpatient parking lot at Riverview Regional Medical Center, according to a news release from the hospital, The Gadsden Times reported.. Patients must call (256) 442-5153 to make an appointment, print and complete the coronavirus testing form available at the hospital’s website, www.riverviewregional.com, and bring their insurance cards. The hospital is located at 300 S. Third St. in Gadsden. Anchorage: Forty-one crew members and passengers of an Alaska state ferry will undergo testing for COVID-19 before disembarking the Tustumena in Homer after another crew member tested positive over the weekend. The crew member on the 198-foot ferry began exhibiting symptoms and tested positive Saturday in Dutch Harbor. The ferry set sail for Homer that night after 21 passengers who boarded in Dutch Harbor were put back on shore. No other tests on crew members or passengers were conducted on Saturday. In all, 35 crew members and six passengers were to undergo testing in Homer, state officials said Monday during a news conference. “No one goes ashore until I say so,” John Falvey, the Alaska Marine Highway System general manager, said. Officials said 16 crew members had close contact with the ferry employee who tested positive. All but one remained on the ship and were in self-isolation. The other person who had close contact left the vessel at the end of a shift, but has been contacted and instructed to self-quarantine. Public health officials in that person’s home jurisdiction are monitoring. Crew members and passengers will be free to leave the ferry while waiting for test results if they head home or to their final destination, where they can quarantine for 14 days. They must also take private transportation to that location, and they cannot expose new individuals, like a cab driver, in getting to their final destination. All the passengers were Alaska residents, officials said. Crew members or passengers who do not meet that criteria or have to take public transportation back to their homes, such as an airplane, will be advised to stay on board the ferry. It wasn’t immediately clear how long the ferry would be out of service. Falvey said a commercial crew might be employed to thoroughly clean the Tustumena. The state is advising anyone who sailed on the Tustumena since June 1 to wear a mask, practice social distancing, check themselves twice daily for symptoms, and get tested for COVID-19 if symptoms do arise, said Dr. Joe McLaughlin, the state epidemiologist. He said even if they don’t have symptoms, they should consider getting tested seven to 14 days after leaving the ship. Phoenix:As COVID-19 numbers in Arizona climbed last week, the state health director sent a letter to hospitals urging them to “fully activate” emergency plans. Hospitals are also being asked to prepare for crisis care, and to suspend elective surgeries if they are experiencing a shortage of staff or bed capacity, Dr. Cara Christ, Arizona Department of Health Services director, said in the June 6 letter. The letter was sent on the day after the chief clinical officer of Arizona’s largest health system – Banner Health – said ICU bed occupancy was growing, and that if current trends continued would exceed capacity. One day later, Banner Health said it had reached capacity for its nine ECMO machines. ECMO stands for stands for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation – it works like an external lung and is for patients whose lungs get so damaged that they don’t work, even with the assistance of a ventilator. Overall, COVID-19 numbers in Arizona have jumped, hospitalizations have increased and as the percentage of positive COVID-19 tests showed increases, too. Some experts say Arizona is experiencing a spike in community spread of COVID-19. As of Monday, Arizona cases of COVID-19, rose to 27,678 with 1,047 known deaths. Maricopa County has the 26th-highest number of confirmed cases of any county in the U.S., according to Johns Hopkins University. In her letter, Christ asked hospital leaders to review a state crisis plan in order to “make determinations for moving your facility from conventional care to contingency care and prepare for crisis care.” Christ also told hospitals to fully activate their emergency plan, in keeping with an executive order from Gov. Doug Ducey that called for expanding hospital bed capacity, first by 25% and then by 50%. Little Rock: Gov. Asa Hutchinson backed off the possibility of allowing just some parts of the state to lift more coronavirus restrictions as the number of people hospitalized from the virus hit a new high. It’s not clear when Hutchinson will implement “Phase 2,” but he told reporters Monday that he’s not considering a loosening of restrictions by region, an idea he floated last week. Hutchinson said he’s not ready to move away from the state’s plan for the next wave of reopenings to happen statewide. “We’re not ready to make any jumps or changes in that direction,” Hutchinson said. Hutchinson did not completely rule out the possibility of a regional approach later. Arkansas’ rise in recent days has come from northwest Arkansas, which earlier had not seen as much virus activity as other parts of the state. Eighty-six of the new cases came from Washington County and another 41 came from Benton County. Hutchinson cited that change as a concern in shifting to a regional approach. Arkansas in recent weeks has allowed businesses that closed because of the virus to reopen, but with limits on capacity and other safety measures. Arkansas was among a handful of states that did not have a stay-at-home order in place during the pandemic. The number of people hospitalized because of the illness caused by the virus increased by 26 Monday to 171, from 145 Sunday. The state’s death count from COVID-19 increased to 155. The 26 new hospitalizations are the largrest one-day increase Arkansas has since since the start of the pandemic, but Hutchinson and state Health Secretary Dr. Nathaniel Smith have said the state is not near its capacity for hospital beds. The increase in cases also comes as the state has expanded its testing in recent weeks. Hutchinson has set a goal of testing 120,000 by the end of June. Sacramento: Movie theaters can begin opening later this week if they limit theater capacity to 25% or no more than 100 attendees, under state guidance released Monday. The guidance adds movie theaters to a long list of other businesses that can start reopening as the nation’s most populous state relaxes its stay-at-home order. Restaurants, churches, hair salons and retail stores have reopened in many counties. Soon that reopening will expand vastly in counties that can meet certain metrics including number of cases, positive test rates and testing and tracing capabilities. Other entertainment venues that can reopen later include bowling alleys, mini golf courses and arcades. The state recommended movie theaters implement reservation systems, designate arrival times and designating certain seats that people can use so that movie goers can maintain 6 feet of distance from other groups. Moviegoers should, at a minimum, wear face coverings when entering and exiting the theater or buying concessions, the state guidance said. The state also suggests theaters use disposable or washable seat covers that are easy to clean and prop open doors so people don’t have to touch handles. Meanwhile, the state is also allowing film, music and television production to resume subject to labor agreements. Film, television and commercial production make up a significant amount of the Los Angeles economy. Denver: State public schools will need to be flexible about reopening classroom instruction this fall by keeping remote learning options available for students at schools that have coronavirus outbreaks, Gov. Jared Pollis and Dr. Richard Herlihy, the state’s chief epidemiologist, told the education board Monday. Colorado is gradually reopening its economy after a stay-at-home order helped slow the spread of the virus, and school districts can offer computer instruction this summer at facilities with proper social distancing. But Polis warned, “the truth is that nobody knows where we will be in August or September,” when schools reopen. “Most likely, most schools are back already in a normal way and largely in a regular fashion,” the Democratic governor told the State Board of Education. Contingency planning is key, he said. A classroom or school outbreak will require isolation of students and staff they’ve been in contact with. Everyone will be tested before they can return. Polis said strategies for preventing outbreaks include staggering lunch, recreation and hallway use times and keeping classroom students together as a body as much as possible. Special precautions must be taken for staff 60 and over, Herlihy said, especially because most children with the virus are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms. Colorado adults age 60 and older are 21% of the state’s population but account for 50% of coronavirus hospitalizations and 90% of deaths caused by the virus. Districts should allow older staff to have the opportunity to teach remotely, they said. Hartford: The Department of Energy and Environmental Protection plans to reopen campgrounds beginning July 8. Campers with recreational vehicles or RVs will be able to keep their reservations starting July 1. Anyone with reservations before those dates will be provided refunds. New reservations for the season can be made online beginning July 20. The deaprtment is hiring and training staff to clean bathrooms and other facilities to maintain standards required by health officials during the coronavirus pandemic. The agency has also obtained protective gear and made safety changes to camp office buildings. Wilmington:Gov. John Carney has extended Delaware’s state of emergency over the coronavirus pandemic through the end of June. The emergency was first declared mid-March and must be extended every 30 days. The emergency order includes requirements for residents to wear face masks in public and restrictions on business operations to limit spread of the virus. The state has for the past two weeks been lifting some of Carney’s original restrictions – reopening beaches, short-term rentals, retail businesses and dine-in services at restaurants with limited capacity. Many restaurants and businesses were allowed to reopen June 1, but it didn’t trigger the economic reawakening the state had hoped for, as many stores remained closed over fears of the coronavirus and looting in Wilmington and Dover after police brutality protests. Churches this weekend were also allowed to resume services, with many religious leaders saying they would implement social distancing rules. The next round of business reopenings begins June 15. Businesses that were allowed to reopen this week will be able to expand their occupancy from 30% to 60% of their designated fire code occupancy, the governor said at a press briefing. This mostly applies to restaurants, retail, convention centers and arts organizations. Gyms, however, will remain at 30% occupancy. Indoor gatherings of up to 50 people will also be allowed, and child care centers will also be open. The state is recommending parents keep their children home, if possible. Washington: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell criticized D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser for restricting church services while allowing protests during the COVID-19 pandemic. “I have no criticism for the millions of Americans who peacefully demonstrated in recent days. Their cause is beyond righteous,” the Kentucky Republican said on the Senate floor. “It is the inconsistency from leaders that has been baffling,” he added, singling out Bowser for what he said is selectively allowing racial justice protests but not church services during the pandemic. McConnell argued that restrictions on religious ceremonies are not consistent with allowing rallies and protests against police brutality in response to the death of George Floyd. “Here in the District of Columbia, the mayor celebrates massive street protests. She actually joins them herself, but on her command, churches and houses of worship remain shut,” McConnell said. “I believe even the largest church buildings in the District are still subject to the 10-person limit for the things the mayor deems inessential.” Tallahassee: U.S. Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York, the top Senate Democrat, called on the Department of Labor to investigate Florida’s glitch-ridden unemployment system, asserting that the state mismanaged claims and failed to deliver timely benefits after massive job losses from the coronavirus pandemic. In a letter to the department’s inspector general, Schumer joined the ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, in requesting an inquiry into the Department of Labor’s oversight of the Florida Department of Economic Opportunity, which administers the application portal for jobless benefits. The Democratic senators assert that the state has only paid 28% of the 2 million Floridians applying for benefits since March 15 – but that assertion appeared to rely on month-old data. According to current statistics from Florida’s Department of Economic Opportunity, more than half of unemployment claims have been paid. The department contends that more than 90% of 1.3 million eligible claimants it has processed have been paid. But the state’s calculation does not include nearly 500,000 people deemed ineligible, as well as hundreds of thousands more that are apparently still waiting for their claims to be processed. A spokesperson for Gov. Ron DeSantis, Helen Ferre, dismissed Schumer’s call for an investigation as “partisan politics.” Ferre noted that the governor has called one of his own inspectors general to conduct an investigation into the online portal known as CONNECT. “More than $4.6 billion has been paid to close to 1.3 million Florida residents,” Ferre said, “and under Governor DeSantis’ direction, more will be done to ensure that all who are owed unemployment benefits receive them.” Augusta:Georgia appears to be slowing to about 600 new cases of COVID-19 a day over the past few days, with a smaller amount of deaths, but Augusta saw a big influx of new cases and two new deaths, according to new data. Georgia saw an additional 599 cases of COVID-19 on Monday to bring its total to 52,497, with 28 new deaths for a total of 2,208, the Department of Public Health reported Monday. In the Augusta area, Richmond County had a spike of 18 new cases to raise its total to 645, Columbia County had four more for 278, Screven County had an additional case for 58, Jefferson County saw one more for 51, and Jenkins County increased two more to 29. All other counties remained the same Monday: Burke at 125, McDuffie at 72, Wilkes at 343, Warren at 18, Lincoln at 16, and Glascock and Taliaferro at one each. Richmond County had two more deaths for 32 total, which raised the Augusta toll to 59 after more deaths over the weekend. Georgia got 11,885 test results in Monday, of which 5% were positive, according to an analysis by The Augusta Chronicle. The state has now received 649,384 tests, of which 8% have been positive, a rate that has been steadily declining over the past few weeks, according to a Chronicle analysis. Honolulu: Maui County’s unemployment rose to 35% in April, the highest rate in the state, largely because of the massive impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the tourism industry. The economic collapse is a stark reminder there is a price to pay for Maui’s dependence on tourism, which Mayor Mike Victorino estimated supplies about one in three jobs, The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reported Sunday. “We built our economy on agriculture and hospitality industry, which is bar none the most lucrative economic base that people could see,” Victorino said. “Now we need to look at what other types of occupations or businesses that we can start that are not directly tied into the tourists.”Maui visitor arrivals rose from 1.8 million in 2009 to 2.9 million in 2018, a 54% gain that was the largest increase on any island. Maui visitor arrivals in 2019 rose more than 5% to 3.1 million and spending increased more than 2% to $5 billion. Before coronavirus fears and government health restrictions devastated Hawaii’s tourism, Maui was the state’s top hotel market. In April 2019, Maui was tied with Honolulu for the lowest unemployment level in the state. Recently more than 1,500 unemployed Maui hotel workers from three top resorts turned out to collect food packages paid for by their owner, Host Hotels & Resorts. They included employees of Andaz Maui at Wailea, the Fairmont Kea Lani and the Hyatt Regency Maui Resort and Spa. Twin Falls: Gov. Brad Little and lawmakers have announced a plan allowing cities and counties to tap into $200 million of federal coronavirus relief money to pay police and other public safety workers as long as property taxes are also reduced. The plan announced Monday is using part of the $1.25 billion Idaho received in federal rescue money to help with the pandemic. Little’s Coronavirus Financial Advisory Committee will complete specific details. “Our focus is to support our communities and our police, fire, and EMS personnel and ensure there are no reductions in public safety during these unprecedented challenges,” Little said in a statement. “I appreciate the cities and counties working with us to ensure the resulting budget savings are given back to the people of Idaho in the form of property tax relief rather than backfilling local government budgets.” Property taxes became a top issue in the legislative session earlier this year as explosive growth in parts of the state caused property values to increase, forcing up property taxes. Some longtime homeowners said they were being forced from their homes. Several property tax relief bills were introduced during the session that ended in March as the virus started spreading, but none of the bills became law. Twin Falls County Commissioner Don Hall said Little’s plan will help support public safety workers while not burdening property owners. The $1.25 billion needs to be used by Dec. 30. About $650 million has now been allocated. Idaho is in the third stage of Little’s four-stage plan to reopen during the pandemic. Nearly all businesses can now open under the guidelines. Chicago: The financial cost of the coronavirus pandemic in Chicago continues to climb as another major trade show has been canceled. The International Manufacturing Technology Show that was scheduled to be held at McCormick Place in September has been scrapped because of the pandemic. More than 129,000 people had signed up to attend the show, one of the largest in the city, and McCormick Place spokeswoman Cynthia McCafferty told the Chicago Tribune that the show was expected to account for more than 99,300 hotel room nights. Conventions are crucial to the city’s financial health and the show is the latest of nearly 100 events at McCormick Place to be canceled this year. McCafferty said those cancellations add up to a loss of more than $1.4 billion that attendees would have spent on things like hotels, entertainment, restaurants and transportation. Organizers of the convention that has been held every even-numbered year in Chicago since 1947 said the uncertainty of just when conventions might return to Illinois under Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s five-phase reopening plan prompted them to cancel. Under the plan, gatherings of more 50 people can’t resume until the final phase. In order to get to that phase, either a vaccine must be available or there must be a highly effective treatment in place. The Association for Manufacturing Technology, the trade group that owns and manages the show, did not see that happening by the time the show was scheduled to be held, according to Peter Eelman, vice president of exhibitions and chief experience officer for the association. Indianapolis: Most of the state’s casinos can reopen as soon as next week under coronavirus safety plans they have submitted, an Indiana Gaming Commission official said Monday. The 13 state-regulated casinos have been closed since mid-March when widespread shutdowns started to slow the coronavirus spread. The Michigan-based Pokagon Band of Potawatomi Indians announced Monday that it also plans to reopen its South Bend, Indiana, casino and three in southwestern Michigan on June 15. The Indiana Gaming Commission required casino safety plans to include how they would encourage 6-foot distancing between gamblers and limit the number of people at table games, along with requiring face masks for employees. Indiana casinos could still face greater restrictions from local health officials. The Indiana casinos have remained closed even as Gov. Eric Holcomb has eased coronavirus restrictions on most other businesses beginning in early May. At least 7,000 Indiana casino workers have lost jobs during the shutdowns, according to layoff notices submitted to state officials. The casino closures have also cost state government more than $110 million in projected tax revenue during March, April and May. The Indiana casinos will decide how quickly they will reopen, although those that have submitted new safety plans are allowed to do so as early as 6 a.m. June 15, said Jennifer Reske, rhe Indiana Gaming Commission ‘s executive director. Many casinos will have fewer electronic games available as they provide greater distancing and some will spread machines and tables farther apart in their gambling areas, she said. Des Moines:The Des Moines Farmers Market said that an online platform has been created in partnership with UnityPoint Health-Des Moines for people to order products from vendors and pick them up or have them delivered. More than 100 vendors are participating in the platform, according to a news release from the farmers market. The platform will provide a way for vendors who rely on the market to generate income and for residents to purchase locally grown food. Customers can find the online market through the farmers market’s website. People can browse the hundreds of offerings without registering for an account but must registered to purchase and arrange delivery or pick-up times. The site includes a search option for products, options to choose products that are available for pickup and delivery, and to sort products by supplier. Profiles of suppliers are also available on the site. Products and vendors will be added to the platform throughout the summer, the release stated. Topeka: Kansas counties “shouldn’t feel pressure” to loosen restrictions if they aren’t seeing a decline in new coronavirus cases or new hospitalizations, Gov. Laura Kelly said Monday, with cases increasing faster in the four most populous counties than the state as a whole. Kelly said she’s feeling hopeful because Kansas is making enough progress in containing the novel coronavirus for most of the state’s 105 counties to loosen restrictions further. Her office and the state Department of Health and Environment are advising local officials that as of Monday they can allow mass gatherings of up to 45 people, permit nonessential travel and open swimming pools and summer camps. But she and Dr. Lee Norman, the health department’s top administrator, acknowledged there are counties not seeing a drop in new cases and hospitalizations or are likely to see declines halt. Norman listed three of the state’s four most populous counties – Sedgwick, Shawnee and Wyandotte – as examples. The state health department reported Monday that Kansas saw coronavirus cases increase 2.5% from Friday, up 257 to a total of 10,650 since the pandemic reached the state in early March. The three counties Norman mentioned, plus Johnson County, the state’s most populous county, together accounted for 55% of the new cases since last week. Hodgenville: The Abraham Lincoln Birthplace is increasing visitor access and services this week with guidance from government health officials about the coronavirus pandemic. The park reopened access Monday to its visitors center, from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily. Access will remain closed to the visitors center bookstore, the Memorial Building and in-person, ranger-led interpretive programs. The National Park Service is phasing in increased access on a park-by-park basis, it said in a news release. The public should follow local health orders and avoid crowds and high-risk outdoor activities, the release said. Details and updates are available online and on social media channels. Shreveport:After spending roughly $18,600 on work-related travel in 2019, Mayor Adrian Perkins’ 2020 travel has been slowed by the COVID-19 pandemic to less than $10,000. Financial records for Perkins show work-related travel expenses for 2019 included mayor’s conferences, a northwest Louisiana legislative session, technology summit, and an October trip to Dallas for a meeting with the Federal Aviation Administration regarding airport leases. The mayor’s 2019 work-related travel expenses were roughly $18,600, with the bulk of those expenses in hotel and airfare. Some of the mayor’s travel for speaking engagements and leadership development were covered by the host. In 2020, the mayor traveled to the nation’s capital from Jan. 21-26 for the U.S. Conference of Mayors, for a total cost of $6,063. The mayor’s work-related travel halted after the U.S. Mayor’s Conference and the onset of COVID-19. With a budget shortfall this spring, there has been speculation about curtailing mayoral travel. Portland: A federal appeals court is expected to hear an appeal from an evangelical church that challenged a ban on large gatherings by Gov. Janet Mills. The ban from Mills prevented worshipers from attending services in person until recently because of the coronavirus pandemic. The appeal from Calvary Chapel in Orrington will be considered by 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston, though a date for oral arguments has not been set, the Bangor Daily News reported. The state has argued that Mills’ order was constitutional because it didn’t target houses of worship specifically. It included many places people gather, including theaters and bars. U.S. District Judge Nancy Torresen ruled in May that the restriction served the public interest Annapolis: A county health official is urging people who participated in recent protests against police brutality to get tested for the new coronavirus. The Capital Gazette reported Monday that Anne Arundel County’s health officer Nilesh Kalyanaraman recommended the tests to protesters who gathered in large crowds. Kalyanaraman said his fingers were crossed that the number of infections don’t rise. And he credited many demonstrators for wearing masks to the protests. But he also noted the challenges of maintaining social distance. “The reality is we’re going to see what happens with our numbers,” he said. The county is recovering from a peak in virus cases. Maryland and Anne Arundel County have seen 14 days of falling hospitalization rates as well as declining positive test results. Kalyanaraman said it will take about 10 days for data to give the first sense of how protests might affect coronavirus numbers. But it will take another three to four weeks for a clearer picture to emerge. Boston: Plimoth Plantation, a living history museum that highlights the lives of the Pilgrims and the Wampanoag Tribe soon after the arrival of the Mayflower in 1620, is reopening this week. The museum’s outdoor areas and a limited number of buildings are opening to members on Wednesday and to the general public on Thursday, according to a release on its website. The Plymouth facility closed in mid-May in response to the coronavirus pandemic. Capacity at the 30-acre site is limited and management is asking visitors to purchase tickets in advance. Visitors are asked to wear masks, follow one-way pathways and stay distant from other parties. The museum is also placing hand santizing stations throughout the facility. Employees will also wear masks. The museum’s Patuxet Wampanoag Homesite, 17th-century English village, the barn and animal pastures and gardens are opening. Plimoth Plantation is open seven days a week. Lansing: The Michigan Gaming Control Board approved minimum reopening guidelines for commercial casinos, though they remain closed amid the coronavirus pandemic under an order from Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. Many of the 24 tribal casinos in Michigan, which are not regulated by the state, have already reopened or will do so soon. During their initial reopening, MGM Grand Detroit, MotorCity Casino and Greektown Casino will limit capacity at no more than 15% and keep poker rooms and self-serve buffets closed. They will have to check temperatures of everyone entering and frequently clean slot machines. Patrons will be required to wear a mask unless drinking or eating. Revenues at the three casinos, which have been closed since March 16 in a city that was hit hard by the virus, were down nearly 52% through May compared to a same point a year ago. Whitmer could let the casinos open in coming weeks. Bars and restaurants on Monday reopened tables, at 50% capacity, after previously being limited to takeout and delivery. Day camps, outdoor pools, libraries and museums also could open under an order issued a week ago. St. Cloud:A flyover, a virtual fireworks display and a brief live fireworks salute will mark July 4 festivities in St. Cloud this summer and replace the usual fireworks and gatherings at Hester and Wilson Parks, according to a press release Monday from the STC Fireworks Committee Board. Even as some businesses are opening amid the COVID-19 pandemic, organizers of the annual fireworks celebration took a cautious route. A military flyover will salute the community and the honorary commissioners on July 4. The honorary commissioners are those who helped reduce the spread of the coronavirus and essential workers, including health care providers, grocery and transportation workers, and other key staff, including U.S. military personnel, according to the press release. Although there will be no pyrotechnics from a barge in the Mississippi River, the fireworks committee has planned “a brief and dynamic live fireworks salute to July 4th from a secure, remote location,” according to the release. Residents will be able to look for those fireworks at 10 p.m. on July 4 from their doorsteps or backyards. Media outlets and the Fireworks Committee’s social media sites will post the location of the fireworks just before 10 p.m. July 4 so people know where to look from their homes. Jackson: Gov. Tate Reeves said the state still faces danger from the coronavirus pandemic, and people should not harass or make fun of those who follow public health recommendations to wear masks in public. During a news conference, a Columbus reporter asked about “mask shaming.” Joey Barnes of WCBI-TV said he had his face covered while shopping at Walmart and a man looked him in the eye and coughed three short times. “It’s wrong,” Reeves said. “If people want to wear a mask into a Walmart or into a restaurant or into any other business – not only should they be allowed to do so; in many instances, they ought to be credited for doing so. … Everyone out there that is choosing to wear a mask is actually doing something good for their fellow Mississippians.” Thousands of people in Jackson and hundreds more in several other cities took part in demonstrations Saturday to protest police violence against African Americans. Masks were prevalent among protesters. Reeves said Monday that he supports the right to protest and he was pleased the Mississippi events were peaceful. But, he said he’s concerned that protesters who stood close to each other could unintentionally spread the virus to people who are medically vulnerable. “My concern is, what if those individuals went and protested on Saturday and then went and had Sunday lunch with their grandmom,” Reeves said. Reeves said he and the state health officer, Dr. Thomas Dobbs, spent Monday morning in phone calls with mayors and county supervisors urging them to be vigilant about trying to slow the spread of the virus. Springfield:In a tweet Monday night, the National Rifle Association announced its annual membership meeting will be held Sept. 5 at the Springfield Expo Center. The meeting was previously scheduled for April 18 in Nashville, Tennessee, but was rescheduled because of the coronavirus pandemic. The meeting with take place in Halls A/B/C of the Expo Center and begins at 9 a.m. Helena: Nine new cases of COVID-19 were reported in Montana between Saturday and Monday, increasing the state’s total count to 548, the state health department said. The state reported one new case of COVID-19 on Saturday, five new cases on Sunday and three new cases on Monday. Three were reported in Big Horn county, three in Gallatin county, two in Yellowstone County and one in Stillwater County. Big Horn County health officials announced a new order to prevent the spread of COVID-19 that is more restrictive than the state directive after the county reported its first death on Friday, bringing the state’s death count to 18. Employees at all Big Horn County businesses must now have their temperature checked before starting work. People with temperatures over 100 degrees are not allowed to work. Dine-in establishments in the county are now limited to 50% capacity, while establishments in other parts of the state are permitted to operate at 75% capacity. Big Horn restaurants, convenience stores, bars and lodging must require employees to wear cloth masks. The new measures in Big Horn County are more restrictive than the statewide directive, and come as Montana marks a week since Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock announced the beginning of the second phase of reopening. Lincoln: Two members of the Nebraska National Guard who helped police during recent protests have tested positive for the new coronavirus, and the the Guard said it plans to test all of its personnel still on duty in Omaha and Lincoln. The Lincoln Journal Star reported nearly 600 members of the National Guard were assigned to assist law enforcement agencies beginning May 31 following several nights of protests in Nebraska after the death of George Floyd in Minnesota. The two guard members who began to show symptoms of COVID-19 on Saturday were tested through Test Nebraska, which confirmed they contracted the virus. “They are isolating, and we are now going to test all of the personnel still on duty for this mission in Lincoln or Omaha,” said Maj. Scott Ingalsbe, public affairs officer for the Nebraska National Guard. Although the National Guard made adjustments to follow social distancing guidelines the best it could, and asked members to wear masks, Ingalsbe said it “was not always feasible” while they were working. Ingalsbe said the National Guard will wrap up its role supporting police in Lincoln and Omaha, as well as the Nebraska State Patrol, on Tuesday. Reno:A 35-year-old Reno man awaits sentencing after pleading guilty to stealing hundreds of surgical masks from a Veterans Affairs hospital amid the coronavirus pandemic. Peter Lucas pleaded guilty Thursday in U.S. District Court in Reno to one count of theft in connection with health care. The U.S. Attorney’s Office for Nevada said Lucas faces up to a year in prison and a fine of up to $250,000 when sentenced Sept. 9. According to court documents, the thefts happened in March and surveillance cameras caught Lucas stealing at least four boxes of surgical masks from supply carts and hiding them under his jacket before leaving the hospital. Each box contained 50 masks. According to the office, Lucas was a compensated member of a VA work therapy program that helps veterans find work.. KOLO-TV reported that a criminal complaint said Lucas admitted to police he took four boxes and that he said he took them to give the masks to homeless people. Concord: The Libertarian Party of New Hampshire has sued Gov. Chris Sununu and Secretary of State Bill Gardner, saying that the required 3,000 signatures needed from registered voters to get candidates on the ballot for the 2020 elections is unreasonable during the coronavirus pandemic. New Hampshire Public Radio reported in a complaint filed in federal court Monday, the Libertarian Party said signatures are typically collected door-to-door, and it is less safe to do that now. The party is asking the state to lower the signature requirement or suspend it altogether for the upcoming elections. The New Hampshire Attorney General’s office said it is reviewing the case and will respond. Similar lawsuits have been filed on behalf of Libertarians in Georgia, Illinois and Pennsylvania. Trenton:Effective immediately, limited indoor gatherings and outdoor gatherings of up to 100 people can resume in an easing of rules meant to slow the spread of the new cornavirus, Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy said Tuesday. The governor also said that outdoor demonstrations protected by the First Amendment, including religious services and protests stemming from George Floyd’s death, can be held, regardless of the number of attendees. “We believe such a rule appropriately prioritizes individuals’ rights to speak and worship freely,” he said during a news conference. He said he planned to increase the limits for other outdoor gatherings to 250 people by June 22 and to 500 people by July 3. The decision comes a day after Murphy was criticized by political opponents for attending rallies over the weekend, apparently in violation of his own executive order limiting gatherings to 25 people or fewer. Indoor gatherings must be limited to 25% of capacity or 50 people, Murphy said. The previous limit for outdoor gatherings was 25 people. He said there is no requirement to reopen. “No one should reopen unless and until they feel fully confident in their ability to do so,” Murphy said. Santa Fe: New Mexico’s lead specialist for tracking and combating infectious disease is leaving the state Health Department amid the coronavirus pandemic. Michael Landen retired as state epidemiologist to be closer to relatives in Virginia, where his parents live, said Health Department spokesman David Morgan. Landen was appointed in 2012 under Republican Gov. Susana Martinez and was a leading figure in the state’s response to the opioid epidemic before COVID-19 arrived in March. Deputy Epidemiologist Chad Smelser will lead the epidemiology and response division, and a nationwide search takes place for Landen’s successor, Health Secretary Kathy Kunkel announced Tuesday. Smelser accompanied Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham at news conferences in the early stages of the pandemic.New Mexico aggressively pursued public health restrictions at the outset of the epidemic and this month allowed dine-in restaurants, shopping malls, gyms and hair salons to reopen at limited capacity. A spike in statewide infections over the past week tied to an outbreak at prison facilities in Otero County has changed the outlook for New Mexico and efforts to safely reopen the economy. Albany:The seven-county Hudson Valley region entered Phase 2 of the state’s four-phase reopening Tuesday, which includes allowing in-person retail stores and hair salons to open their doors and letting outdoor dining at restaurants and bars. The positive news comes as the economy looks to slowly recover from the coronavirus pandemic that killed more than 24,000 New Yorkers, including 2,600 in the Hudson Valley, and led to double-digit unemployment rates. The Mid-Hudson region includes Dutchess, Orange, Putnam, Rockland, Sullivan, Ulster and Westchester counties. Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced late Monday the Hudson Valley had met the metrics to move to Phase 2. “The global public health experts advising New York State have reviewed the data and numbers for the Mid-Hudson region and cleared this part of the state to move ahead into Phase II of the reopening,” Cuomo said in a statement. “New Yorkers have been smart and disciplined throughout the COVID-19 outbreak, and it is essential for residents and businesses to continue to follow all necessary precautions to ensure the virus does not spread as we advance the Mid-Hudson reopening.” All of upstate New York is in Phase 2, and New York City entered Phase 1 on Monday. Long Island is set to hit Phase 2 on Wednesday. Altamahaw: Alamance County Sheriff Terry Johnson said he won’t cite a local stock car speedway for violating the state’s prohibition against mass gatherings because of COVID-19 after another large crowd gathered there for races. The decision by Johnson appears to open the door for Gov. Roy Cooper to seek legal action against the owner of Ace Speedway, which has held racing on each of the past three weekends. Cooper’s executive order caps most outdoor meetings to 25 people. Media outlets have reported crowds at the speedway exceeding 2,000, including the one on Saturday. The governor’s office wrote to Johnson last week telling him to perform his duty over the weekend and enforce Cooper’s order. A placard at the speedway on Saturday read: “This event is held in peaceful protest of injustice and inequality everywhere.” Gatherings to express First Amendment rights are exempt from the order. Johnson wrote on Monday that no action was taken on other tracks that raced over the weekend. “This concerns me greatly to know that my citizens have basically been singled out for the same alleged violations that are occurring all over the state of North Carolina,” he wrote in a statement. “I assure you that I respect the Office of the Governor of North Carolina but I have serious reservations on the legality of his order.” Cooper said at a media briefing that opening the speedway to crowds was a “reckless decision” by the owner. Bismarck: State health officials said Tuesday that 22 more people have tested positive for the new coronavirus in North Dakota, but no additional deaths have been reported. More than half of the new positive results reported are in Cass County, which includes the city of Fargo and remains the epicenter of the state’s coronavirus outbreak. The state Department of Health said the new numbers increase the number of positive cases to 2,901 with 114 individuals recovered since Monday bringing the total number of recovered people to 2,450. There have been 72 deaths associated with COVID-19 in North Dakota. Toledo: The state’s two big amusement parks will open in early July, but initially to season pass holders only. Kings Island near Cincinnati will open on July 2 and Cedar Point in Sandusky will start its season on July 9, the parks announced on Tuesday. Both will only be open to season pass holders to start, with other guests welcomed at a later date. The parks, which had delayed their openings because of the coronavirus pandemic, said they will require all visitors to wear masks and complete health screenings and temperature checks. Cedar Point and Kings Island along with an indoor water park operator sued the state last week, saying Ohio officials did not have the authority to shut them down. The lawsuit came after Gov. Mike DeWine had allowed other tourism businesses to open, including zoos, museums and aquariums. A day later, DeWine announced that amusement parks could reopen. Online reservations also will be required for visitors and social distancing will be in place throughout the parks, including in the lines for rides. Both parks, which are owned by Ohio-based Cedar Fair Entertainment Co., said it will announce at a later date when its water parks will open. Oklahoma City: There were 158 new coronavirus cases in Oklahoma and five additional deaths because of COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus, the Oklahoma State Department of Health reported Tuesday. There have been at least 7,363 confirmed cases and 353 deaths in the state, up from 7,205 cases and 348 deaths reported Monday. The actual number of people who have contracted a virus is likely higher because many people have not been tested, and studies suggest people can be infected and not feel sick. The department also reported 148 people hospitalized after either testing positive for the virus or under investigation for infection. A total of 6,073 people have recovered from the illness, according to the department. Salem:Crater Lake National Park, Oregon’s only national park, reopened Monday following an extended closure to limit the spread of COVID-19. The park began a phased opening that includes Munson Valley Road, West Rim Drive and North Entrance Road, weather permitting, parks officials said. Much of the park and its trails remain snow-covered – and an additional blanket of snow is forecast to fall this weekend – but Monday marked the first time people could enter and explore since March. Boat tours at the lake are canceled this season, and at least in the beginning, park information centers and bookstores, vault toilets and other buildings will remain closed. However, the back country office will be open to issue overnight permits and the Rim Village facilities will be open in part. Visit www.travelcraterlake.com for the details on what is open and closed. Visitors will be encouraged to pay entrance fees in advance by purchasing them online, and anyone paying at the entrance booth is encouraged to use a credit card, officials said. East Rim Drive and Pinnacles Road continue to be closed as they usually are this time of year because of snow, along with Watchman Peak, Garfield Peak and Cleetwood trails. Harrisburg: Five more coronavirus testing sites are opening in underserved areas of Pennsylvania. Beginning Wednesday, drive-thru testing sites will be open in Walmart parking lots in Mill Hall, Punxsutawney, Bradford, Cranberry and Warren. They will join five other testing sites that opened Friday at Walmart stores in Clarion, Erie, Montoursville, Clearfield and Hermitage. The tests are free. Registration is required a day in advance. Patients can create an account at www.MyQuestCOVIDTestPA.com. Providence: Bryant University and the town of Smithfield have canceled this year’s Fourth of July holiday fireworks display and concert, the school announced Tuesday. Restrictions on large gatherings because of the coronavirus pandemic made holding the event, scheduled for July 2, difficult, the school said. “We know that Smithfield residents and members of Bryant’s campus community look forward to the annual fireworks and Navy Band concert, however COVID-19 presents a continuing health threat, and the safety of our community and neighbors is Bryant’s highest priority,” the school said in a statement. Spartanburg:The city won’t be able to follow through on an earlier commitment to award raises to its police officers because of lost tax revenue from the coronavirus pandemic. The City Council tentatively approved a budget Monday for next fiscal year that’s roughly $1.7 million less than anticipated because of a loss in hospitality and business license tax revenue. The shortfall also means the city won’t be able to immediately move forward with a planned, new downtown fire station at 450 Wofford Street. The budget for the upcoming fiscal year (July 1-June 30, 2021) is about $42 million, slightly below the current budget of the 2019-20 fiscal year, city manager Chris Story said. The final vote on approval of the 2020-21 budget will be during the next meeting on June 22. Sioux Falls: Gov. Kristi Noem on Monday took to social media to vaunt her response to the coronavirus pandemic and pitch herself as a leading conservative governor. Throughout the pandemic, Noem, a Republican, has held regular press briefings, taking questions from reporters. On Monday, she instead posted a nearly 9-minute video in which Noem said she has prioritized “freedom,” but claimed the “mainstream media” has attacked her for doing so. “More freedom, not more government is the answer,” Noem said. Although the sparsely-populated and Republican-dominated state might be an afterthought in many national political conversations, Noem has courted attention from conservative pundits and President Donald Trump, including seeking political advice from Trump’s former campaign-manager Corey Lewandowski. She has stuck to some of the most lax regulations of any governor to mitigate the spread of the coronavirus and has often contrasted her hands-off approach to places like New York or New Jersey. Recently, she began positioning herself as a leading conservative governor, using the line: “There’s no governor in America that has trusted their people to make the right choices more than I have.” She also shifted her messaging on her strategy for the coronavirus. During the pandemic, Noem said repeatedly that she was using the “data, facts and science” to guide her decision-making. But in the video, Noem called out leaders from other states, saying, “A blind reliance on insufficient modeling has led some governor’s to enact disastrous lock downs.” Oneida: Big South Fork National River and Recreation Area in Tennessee and Kentucky has reopened parts of the park, coordinating with health officials during the coronavirus pandemic. Bandy Creek Stables and Camp Store reopened access on June 2, and Charit Creek Lodge moved into its second phase of reopening on June 1, allowing overnight guests. No date has been set to allow for day use guests at the lodge. The Station Camp Campground also opened. Blue Heron Campground, Bear Creek Horse Camp and Alum Ford Campground are opening Thursday. The park said in a news release that the National Park Service is working with public health officials to monitor the pandemic and phasing in increased access on a park-by-park basis. The public should follow local area health orders and avoid crowds and high-risk outdoor activities, the park service said Austin: The state will push for increased coronavirus testing in minority communities that have been hit hard by expanding walk-up and drive-through testing sites, Gov. Greg Abbott said. The Republican also said Texas will be poised to react to any surge in cases that might come from exposure in large public demonstrations that have been held since the death of former Houston resident George Floyd in Minneapolis. “We must address the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on underserved and minority communities and ensure that anyone who needs a test can get one,” Abbott said. The move comes after several black lawmakers complained the state hasn’t adequately addressed their pleas for better racial data and efforts to decrease COVD-19′s decidedly deadly toll on black Americans. Many of the more than 70,000 confirmed cases and 1,700 deaths on the state’s case dashboard do not have information on race and ethnicity. The Texas Division of Emergency Management is working with local officials in Dallas, San Antonio, the Rio Grand Valley and several other areas to ramp up testings sites for each community, Abbott said. Salt Lake City: Former Republican Gov. Jon Huntsman Jr. has tested negative for COVID-19, several days after his campaign revealed one of its staffers had the new coronavirus. Huntsman is one of four Republican gubernatorial candidates on the June primary ballot. Campaign manager Lisa Roskelley said Monday that two more staff members tested positive for COVID-19 and five tested negative, including Huntsman and herself, the Deseret News reported. The campaign has not identified the staffers or their positions. Huntsman went into quarantine last week and canceled all of his public appearances after learning his campaign staff was at risk from the virus, the Salt Lake Tribune reported.“The health of each member of our team and the public is our primary concern,” Huntsman said Friday. “We will follow the instructions of health experts and not put politics and campaign concerns ahead of health and safety.” His campaign headquarters closed for cleaning last week and is now reopened but Huntsman continues to work from home while his family awaits their test results, officials said. His running mate, Provo Mayor Michelle Kaufusi, has not had recent contact with the affected staffers and has been cleared to continue campaigning in person, Roskelley said. Winooski: A spike in coronavirus cases in this small city has hit tightly knit immigrant communities where a language barrier might have prevented some from knowing how to prevent the spread or get tested, some immigrant community members said Tuesday. “It is kind of spreading pretty badly,” said Kamal Pradhan, a Bhutanese American, who said he knows of roughly 40 in the Bhutanese community who have been infected with COVID-19. He got tested Tuesday. Harka Khadka, a landlord and community organizer, who is also from Bhutan and lives in Winooski, where the outbreak started, said several of his tenants from the Congo also have been infected. Many are now getting tested, they said. According to the Vermont Health Department, 598 people have been tested at the Winooski site between June 1 and June 7. Interpreters, liaisons and leaders of the communities are urging people, entire families, to come in and get tested, Khadka said. “They trust the interpreters because they need someone to help at the testing site, as well,” he said. “People are coming in big numbers and they are getting tested.” But he worries that fewer non-immigrant Winooski residents are getting tested so that the numbers could be skewed and says some are waiting out the symptoms at home without a test or afraid to get tested.” The outbreak that started on Memorial Day has grown to 62 cases, including at least 24 children, and spread to other communities, Vermont officials said Monday. Nine of the people infected were from the neighboring city of Burlington and five were from other communities. Richmond: Gov. Ralph Northam said students will return to school this fall but with strict new social distancing guidelines aimed at preventing the spread of the new coronavirus. The guidelines unveiled Tuesday call for students to be spaced 6 feet apart at their desks and for teachers who can’t maintain that distance to wear masks. The guidelines also call for limiting access to or closing certain mixed spaces, such as school cafeterias. “All Virginia schools will open for students next year, but the school experience will look very different,” Northam said. Virginia was one of the first states to cancel the school year in March amid the coronavirus pandemic and Northam said the state’s priorities for reopening later this year are on “the health and social, emotional and physical well being of students and staff.” The state’s guidelines are divided into three phases. Most of the state is in the second phase of reopening and Northam said the metrics look good, meaning the state could enter the third phase in coming weeks. The new school guidelines only allow for widespread in-school instruction in Phase 3. Schools can offer summer camps and limited in-school instruction to certain students in Phase 2. Vancouver: Firestone Pacific Foods has started reopening after a coronavirus outbreak infected 132 people and forced the fruit processor to halt operations. The company reopened last week after the Clark County public health department approved it, The Oregonian/OregonLive reported. A Firestone spokesperson said the company plans to ramp up production as more employees return from mandatory 14-day quarantine periods and receive training on new safety procedures. As of Monday morning, 79 employees and another 53 people identified as close contacts of those employees had tested positive for COVID-19. A total of 173 employees and 155 close contacts have been tested. Firestone Pacific Foods CEO Josh Hinerfeld said last month that the company could have done more to protect employees before the outbreak. Washington state health officials temporarily suspended Clark County’s application to move to Phase 2 of Gov. Jay Inslee’s reopening plan because of the Firestone outbreak. Clark County was approved to enter Phase 2 on Friday. Food processing plants have been the sites of coronavirus outbreaks throughout the United States and Pacific Northwest. As of June 1, nearly 300 COVID-19 cases had been linked to agricultural or food processing workplaces in Oregon or southwest Washington, according to a total of publicly disclosed cases. Charleston: Gov. Jim Justice said outdoor concerts at fairs and festivals will be allowed to resume next month as he continues to lift coronavirus restrictions in the state. The Republican governor said the open-air concerts at fairs and festivals can be held starting on July 1. Justice has pushed forward with an aggressive plan to remove virus restrictions on businesses. Casinos and movie theaters were allowed to reopen last week. On Monday, low-contact youth sports teams, as well as middle and high school teams, were allowed to start practicing again. The youth teams can resume games on June 22 with fans in the stands if social distancing rules are followed. Private and state park campgrounds, cabins and lodges are set to reopen to out-of-state guests Wednesday. The governor’s plan to remove restrictions hinges on the state’s positive test rate staying under 3% for three days, loosening a previous goal of having the number of new cases drop for two weeks. Madison: Campgrounds closed since March because of the coronavirus pandemic can reopen starting Wednesday, but it won’t be business as usual. Campers will have to make reservations ahead of time, won’t be able to purchase firewood on site and all buildings, observation towers, playgrounds, concessions and rentals will be closed. But bathrooms will be open as will the reason most campers come to the parks – the trails, boat launches, beaches and outdoor recreation areas. If parks reach capacity, just as has been done since they reopened, they can be closed temporarily until crowding eases, said Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources Secretary Preston Cole. “Concessions won’t be open, so you’ve gotta bring your bug spray, the food you eat, band aids and bandages,” Cole said. Bathrooms will be cleaned daily, and spot-checked, and some drinking fountains might be capped but water will be available for people to use to fill jugs and other containers, Cole said. Firewood won’t be for sale in the parks, and it can’t be brought from farther than 10 miles away, so campers are encouraged to buy it within 10 miles of the parks. So far, parks have had few issues with people not adhering to social distancing guidelines to prevent spread of the virus, Cole said. Casper: The troubled nonprofit partner of Yellowstone National Park, Yellowstone Forever, said Saturday that it was further reducing its staff and suspending the operations of its educational arm, the Yellowstone Forever Institute, the Casper Star-Tribune reproted. The announcement by the organization on its website attributed the decision to severe impacts related to the coronavirus pandemic. It also said the group would reorganize to focus on its mission."
70,70,Want to participate in a protest? You may want to do this with your tech before you goJennifer Jolly ,"Jun. 5, 2020",https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/columnist/2020/06/04/george-floyd-police-protests-tech-facial-recognition-coronavirus/3149030001/,"I have covered more than 100 protests in my tenure as a general assignment news reporter, before turning my focus to tech. Most were peaceful, but I’ve been caught in the midst of the melee, too – pelted with rocks, tear-gassed, and attacked by extremists co-opting nonviolent marches to create chaos nonrelated to the cause. What I learned early on, long before the days of smartphones and social media, is that keeping track of what’s going on – even along the same city block – can be next to impossible. Just gathering information, law enforcement would often tell me one thing, the protest organizers another, and dozens more leaders, marchers, and watchdog groups would say something totally different. Each new hour was often a tangled mess of conflicting information and I felt like – at the end of the day – the only truth I knew for certain, was what I had seen with my own two eyes. Yet even those accounts fell woefully short to tell a fully representative story of what happens during a tense, emotionally charged demonstration.  The fact every single one of us now has a video camera and connection to one another by way of that smartphone in our pockets – helps. But it could also hurt, too. Facial recognition is now a key investigative tool for police departments across the United States, with nearly every major city and many smaller towns searching for a person’s identity with nothing more than a picture of their face, according to the ACLU and Electronic Freedom Foundation.  What you need to know:Protesting George Floyd's death safely Want to blur a face in your video:These video and photo editing tools can help If you want to join a protest and stay out of harm’s way – remember we’re still in the middle of a pandemic – there are several ways tech can help.  On that whole pandemic note though, don’t forget to wear a mask, try to practice social distancing, bring hand sanitizer, and be mindful that we are indeed still dealing with the coronavirus. A new study released this week shows face masks may reduce COVID-19 spread by as much as 85%, so don’t leave home without one.  Remember that teen in Washington who launched an early COVID-19 tracking database and site? Now he and his team (all under the age of 18) have built a website to track protests in all 50 states and Washington, D.C., called 2020Protests. When you open the site, click on your state, city, or town to see the most recent gathering locations, or spot the next general area where an event’s planned.  The site is a work in progress, but it’s a great start getting a lot of local information in one click. One of the young women working on the project, Cameron Quijada, told me over the phone that they're working to provide directions to protests, additional resources to stay safe while demonstrating, information on curfews, whether the state has requested the national guard and how to donate to bail funds, activist organizations, and black-owned businesses.  The other app everyone’s using is called Citizen (iOS, Android), which we first covered back in 2017. This week, App Annie showed Citizen as the fourth most downloaded iOS app of any kind. The hybrid police scanner + social-media-for-crime app has its share of pros and cons, which are the same today as they were in our original story, but it’s become a good place to keep track of protests – or of any potential fallout from the protests happening near you. I’ve used it every night this week to find out about curfews and street closures, and to see out if loud booms late at night near my home were gunfire, fireworks, or “flashbang” stun grenades that law enforcement uses to break up crowds. (It’s been all three.)   The app opens to your neighborhood and lets you zoom in or out to locate colored squares showing clusters of activity. Citizen uses high-powered scanners to track first responders’ public radio channels, then digitizes and transcribes the audio, using an algorithm to pick out keywords and turn them into incidents on the map. People also edit the site to keep what's listed accurate and relevant. You can also add your own videos, comments, and emoji reactions to any incident. Citizen’s guidelines try to keep comments civil, with a slew of rules against hate speech, harassment, and incitement, but it’s still there. Misinformation is an issue too, so use the app with caution.  Hey, Siri:Apple's assistant can quietly video record on command  Twitter: Search ""George Floyd protests (your location) today"" or ""anti-police brutality protests (your location) today."" Replace ""today"" with ""tomorrow"" or ""this week"" for further information and click the “Near you” tab under Search filters.  Facebook’s Event tab: There are different ways to access the Events tab on your Facebook page. The quickest way that I’ve found to do it is by starting at my Home page, clicking Events on the left side of the page, under Explore. After that, type in key terms such as ""protest"" or ""march,"" and make sure the location is set to the area closest to you.  One word of caution here too, misinformation has run amok across social media. Take a moment to read Jessica Guynn’s article on how to protect yourself from hoaxes, conspiracy theories, and other potentially dangerous posts.  There’s conflicting advice on whether to even bring your smartphone to a protest, but when I joined a peaceful, student-led march this past week with my husband and 19-year-old daughter, I wanted my phone nearby to record video, audio, and as a way to keep track of my loved ones.  You could buy a burner phone, or keep your phone in airplane mode which still lets you shoot video on the fly, and try a few of these suggestions as well.  Privacy experts say it’s always best to assume someone, somewhere tracks your every move, that you’re under constant surveillance, and to act accordingly. But your phone could also get lost or stolen, or law enforcement might take it away. To lock it down, use a secure six-digit or longer passcode, and log out of any apps you don’t need. You can also turn off your Wi-Fi radio, disable Bluetooth, and disable location services through your Settings.   Several activists ask that people blur their faces and remove other potentially identifying data from photos and videos, for fear of retaliation. The easiest way to do that is with a new software tool called Image Scrubber. As the site states, “It will remove identifying metadata (Exif data) from photographs, and also allow you to selectively blur parts of the image to cover faces and other identifiable information.” Exif data can include the location of where a photo was taken, and even the model of the device used.  The way it works is simple; open the app, upload a photo, click  “Scrub Exif Data” at the bottom of the screen, then save the image. A tool to blur out parts of the photo automatically pops up next. Click or drag it across parts you want to blur, save again, and you’re done.  You can also use YouTube, Adobe, and other editing software and tools as well, which USA TODAY’s Coral Murphy shows you here.  Removing location data in your phone settings is easy on an iPhone, but can be more complicated depending on which Android device you use.  The reality is that cell service can be spotty at best in large crowds. Many wireless companies’ 4G networks are already operating close to capacity, and smartphone terrestrial antennas easily get overwhelmed. I experienced this with a sudden drop to one, or no, bars during the protest I attended.  Make arrangements in advance with your friends to meet at specific places at specific times if you get separated from each other.  You may want to use code ""signals"" with people you trust. One example includes sending a single emoji that means ""we have to go, meet me at the place we planned."" That’s faster than typing all that information out. Before you head out to any protest, know that in the United States, it is within your rights to demonstrate in public. That includes the basic act of assembling and protesting action by the government, according to the ACLU, which also notes that it protects the right to take video, or otherwise document what’s happening in a public space. But the First Amendment to the Constitution does not protect protesters against any unlawful activity they might commit, which includes destroying property or assaulting other people.

71,71,Don't waste coronavirus tests on those already showing symptoms. There's a smarter way.Dr. Jeremy Samuel Faust and Dr. Harlan Krumholz ,"May 28, 2020",https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2020/05/27/coronavirus-covid-19-testing-symptoms-column/5264406002/,"Universal testing in the United States may be on the way, but it is not around the corner. Acknowledging that regrettable reality means that, in the meantime, we have to decide how to allocate wisely our scarce testing resources. Unfortunately, with limitations on testing we seem to be testing the wrong people for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Most authoritative sources, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, recommend testing people with symptoms. Though that sounds reasonable, it leads to squandering our testing resources on people who we already know are probably infected. Moreover, with high false negative rates from some of the tests, even a negative test in someone with classic symptoms should be assumed to be infected. Until we can achieve universal testing, in order to control the spread of this virus, a better approach must be taken than the one in use today. Starting now, we need to spend vast numbers of available tests on symptom-free essential workers with a high number of daily contacts.  To understand why this is, we first have to understand the two reasons why we test to begin with: surveillance and intervention. Surveillance testing aims to tell epidemiologists how common a disease is. Attempting to glean this simply by tracking the percent of all positive tests being done in a community is prone to sampling bias. If most tests are done in a hospital intensive care unit, the numbers will artificially high. Alternatively, if too many are performed in a relatively unaffected parts of town, the numbers will be artificially low. Proper surveillance can be achieved with random sampling, using with just a small fraction of our testing resources. Such an approach is used all the time in polling data, which are generally accurate within a few percentage points, when done correctly. Intervention testing, in contrast, is designed to break the chain of transmission by lowering the number of infected people who in turn infect others. The key to this virus is that many people are infectious before they develop symptoms — and many never develop symptoms. They become highly efficient spreaders. We need to take people out of circulation who are shedding virus without knowing it. The way to do that is to pick people who are out and about — and interacting with others and test them often to be sure they are not silent carriers. People with symptoms should be taken out of interacting with others reflexively, regardless of any test result. Testing them should not change anything. It is those who do not know they are spreading the virus that we most urgently need to find. Enough! Coronavirus: I was in the stay-home-until-it's-safe camp. But I just can't take it anymore. In either case, we also should notify people that infected individuals have seen recently and warn them that they might be infected — and if they have symptoms they should self-quarantine. If not, they should be tested too and, in an abundance of caution, separate out for a bit. Here’s a starting framework for how we believe our finite number of weekly tests ought to be expended. First, a large number of tests should go towards universal and frequently repeated testing of nursing home residents and staff. A staggering proportion of fatal cases of COVID-19 have originated in long term care facilities, and we must monitor these facilities meticulously. Correctional facilities also deserve routine and widespread testing. From there, we would mostly test symptom-free essential workers who interact with high numbers of people.  While some of these tests might go to health care workers, we need to focus intently on other professions as well, including transit employees, front-line police and fire personnel, grocery store workers, and others in high contact service industries. Even more than health care workers, who are wrapped in protective gear, these other groups are at risk and can be efficient spreaders of the virus.  Sen. Rand Paul and Rep. Andy Biggs:Anthony Fauci wants America closed until there's nothing to reopen This approach reflects an important reality; infected individuals who do not have symptoms are a major reason this pandemic has occurred and also why it will be so hard to quash. It is this evolutionary advantage that SARS-CoV-2 exploits so well. Unlike other respiratory viruses, this one seems to have a remarkable ability to evade detection by our immune systems, at least initially. Instead of making all of its hosts to “get sick” within a couple of days, causing us to voluntarily self-isolate as we usually do while riding out a fever or a nasty cough — a remarkably advantageous evolutionary strategy that we have developed that protects our own communities as much as any personal immunologic functions these misery-inducing strategies may serve — this virus can circulate in our bodies in stealth for many days.  Our strategy identifies hot zones more quickly and allows for earlier intervention. Shutting down one grocery store for a few days where one or more symptom-free case has been detected (while all employees can be tested and the store can be cleaned and abandoned for long enough for trace particles to die out) would be an example of an actionable intervention directly resulting from our strategy that other strategies simply omit wholesale. As we move forward, we predict that the public’s willingness to cooperate with system-wide shelter-in-place orders will diminish. However, there will be utility in doing some of this. Our strategy identifies hot zones sooner, and allows a more surgical approach to future shutdowns. If we can limit shutdowns to relatively smaller areas, we will inhibit spread of the virus without disrupting other parts of the economy that can reasonably carry on. We believe this approach will save many lives while permitting our system to slowly come back online in a stepwise fashion and that can respond to on-the-ground circumstances.

72,72,"SEC, Big 12 to allow football workouts on campus next month","May 22, 2020",https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaf/2020/05/22/sec-to-allow-football-workouts-on-campus-beginning-june-8/111849032/,"Southeastern Conference schools will be able to bring athletes in all sports back to campus for voluntary activities starting June 8 at the discretion of each university, and the Big 12 plans to welcome football players back to campus a week later. The Friday announcements are the latest signs that a college football season will be launched in some form this fall. Other conferences are expected to follow, though decisions could be left to individual schools. The move comes two days after the NCAA Division I Council voted to lift a moratorium on voluntary workouts on campus by football and basketball players, effective June 1. The NCAA updated that ruling Friday by saying voluntary activities would be allowed in all sports starting June 1. “At this time, we are preparing to begin the fall sports season as currently scheduled, and this limited resumption of voluntary athletic activities on June 8 is an important initial step in that process,” SEC Commissioner Greg Sankey said. The SEC initially announced Friday that voluntary in-person activities could resume June 8 on SEC campuses only for football, men’s basketball and women’s basketball. But after the NCAA issued its updated ruling Friday afternoon, the SEC announced that June 8 date would apply to athletes in all sports. Big 12 presidents and chancellors met Friday and decided voluntary activities could begin June 15 for football, July 1 for other fall sports and July 15 for all other sports. SEC officials noted any workouts would take place “under strict supervision of designated university personnel and safety guidelines developed by each institution.” They referred to June 8 as the start of “transition period that will allow student-athletes to gradually adapt to full training and sports activity after this recent period of inactivity.” Permitted actions are limited by the NCAA to voluntary activities supervised by strength and conditioning personnel. Georgia athletic director Greg McGarity said it was “only the first step with further details and plans coming over the next several days and weeks.” “This is an important first step toward having a season this fall, and we will continue to collectively work together as our top priority is to ensure the safety and well-being of our student-athletes, coaches and staff,” Auburn coach Gus Malzahn said in a statement. Defending national champion LSU said it will resume voluntary workouts for players on June 8 in accordance with the SEC decision. “Our administration has worked very hard to make sure that all of the necessary safety procedures and protocols are in place to keep our team safe and healthy,” Tigers coach Ed Orgeron said. “This is a great first step to take in order for us to get back to playing the great game of college football in the fall.” The SEC decided to resume athletic activities with the guidance of a league task force that includes public health, infectious disease and sports medicine professionals from each of the league’s 14 member schools. The task force prepared a series of best practices for screening, testing, monitoring, tracing, social distancing and maintaining clean environments to serve as a guide for each school. Recommendations included testing of symptomatic team members (including athletes, coaches and staffers) as well as screening athletes before they arrive on campus within 72 hours of entering athletic facilities and on a daily basis once they resume athletic activities. Other recommendations include immediate isolation of team members who are diagnosed with COVID-19 or are under investigation, followed by contact tracing under Centers for Disease Control and local public health guidelines. “Health and safety have been our top priority as we’ve gone about this planning process, and we’ll continue to follow guidance from medical experts and health officials as we navigate the coming weeks,” Tennessee athletic director Phillip Fulmer said. “Our staff and student-athletes should be prepared for a ‘new normal,’ as we’ll be implementing changes to how everyone accesses and uses our facilities.” SEC officials said the task force’s recommendations could provide a guide to league members, Sankey noted that each school would get to make its own decisions regarding plans for how to make sure student-athletes return safely. For example, even though the task force’s recommendations only mentioned testing symptomatic team members, Georgia senior associate athletic director for sports medicine Ron Courson said in a statement that the Bulldogs “will conduct COVID testing and perform medical evaluations on all student-athletes.” Florida announced that it also would be testing all of its athletes. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said Friday he thinks college football will return on schedule with at least some spectators. Abbott has already issued new rules to allow youth sports leagues to resume in June and for some professional leagues to hold events without spectators. “Once we get to college football season, our goal right now is to have college football season start as planned, with fans in stands,” Abbott said in an interview with Austin television station KXAN. “What we don’t know is what the capacity level would be.” ___ AP Sports Writers Jim Vertuno, Teresa M.

73,73,"Homeless rerouted, ‘safe’ Margaritaville, summer camps cancel: News from around our 50 statesFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports ","May 27, 2020",https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/05/27/homeless-rerouted-safe-margaritaville-summer-camps-cancel-news-around-states/111867810/,"Montgomery: Some Alabama residents spent the holiday weekend struggling to claim their weekly unemployment benefits. The Alabama Department of Labor told local news outlets that about 53,000 people were blocked from filing the required weekly report telling state government that they still don’t have a job. Only then will another week’s worth of unemployment benefits will be issued. The department said Monday that it had resolved the problems. Although many Alabama residents went to lakes or Gulf of Mexico beaches for the Memorial Day holiday, others watched programs commemorating war dead online as many in-person ceremonies were canceled. New rules from Gov. Kay Ivey went into effect at 5 p.m. Friday allowing entertainment venues like bowling alleys, arcades and theaters, as well as child care facilities, to reopen subject to social-distancing and sanitation rules. Youth sports practices also have been allowed to resume, though competition won’t begin until June 15, and summer camps are now allowed to open. Juneau: The Juneau Assembly could approve more than $1 million in funds to help licensed child care providers whose businesses have been hurt by the coronavirus pandemic. The assembly plans to vote on an emergency measure during a special meeting scheduled for Thursday, KTOO-FM reported Saturday. The vote would commit federal relief funds for distribution to child care providers beginning in June. The program would initially give licensed providers up to $500 per child each month, about half of what they would usually receive in tuition if they were at capacity. The subsidy would decrease to $250 per full-time enrolled child in September. The federal funding will last until year’s end. Funding for a nonemergency, child care stipend program is in the city’s proposed budget. Before the pandemic, city officials identified a lack of affordable child care as a factor keeping new parents from working and hindering the economy. When COVID-19 health restrictions mandates took effect in March, Juneau child care centers with long waiting lists were forced to close. Day care facilities have started reopening as the state relaxes health mandates. The businesses are expected to adopt new practices to reduce the risk of spreading the virus, including decreased enrollment, although the change does not benefit their financial health. Kayenta:Although the Navajo Nation recently surpassed New York to have the highest COVID-19 infection rate in the country, President Jonathan Nez said Monday “the curve is flattening on the Navajo Nation.” As of Monday, the Navajo Nation had 4,794 cases of COVID-19 and the number of deaths associated with the disease reached 157. Nearly 1,500 people have recovered from the virus, according to updated numbers from the Navajo Department of Health. “The Navajo Nation continues to test at a higher rate per capita than any state in the country,” Nez said in a statement, adding that 14.6% of citizens have been tested. Meanwhile, 2.3% of the population in Arizona has been tested, according to the National Association of County and City Health Officials. “Testing, contact tracing, and the public health orders that were implemented months ago requiring protective masks in public and weekend lockdowns are working and flattening the curve,” Nez said. “The numbers are high, but it’s great to see that overall the rate of new cases is flattening, so let’s keep up the good practices and continue to pray for everyone,” Vice President Myron Lizer said in the statement. Little Rock: A federal judge has eased some petition rules for an Arkansas group trying to get a redistricting measure on the ballot, but declined to delay the deadline for submitting the petitions because of the coronavirus pandemic. U.S. District Judge P.K. Holmes on Monday issued a preliminary injunction preventing the state from enforcing on the redistricting group a requirement that signatures on petitions be witnessed in person. Holmes also blocked a requirement that canvassers sign an affidavit in the presence of a notary. Holmes, however, declined to push back the state’s July 3 deadline for submitting petitions by a month or to allow the use of electronic signatures. The group, Arkansas Voters First, sued the state last month and said the pandemic has made it nearly impossible to collect the 89,151 signatures from registered voters needed to qualify for the November election. The group’s proposed constitutional amendment would put a nine-member commission in charge of redrawing congressional and legislative districts Los Angeles: Mendocino County public health officials said Sunday that six more people who participated in a Mother’s Day service at Assembly of God Church in Redwood Valley contracted the new coronavirus, raising the number of cases to nine and making the outbreak responsible for a third of local infections. Meanwhile, Butte County health officials said two of 180 people who attended a Mother’s Day church service in Oroville have tested positive for COVID-19. They said a recent spike in local cases, mostly in the Oroville area, indicate increased community spread. Some places of worship across the country opened their doors over the weekend after President Donald Trump declared such places essential and the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released guidelines for reopening faith organizations. Gov. Gavin Newsom has taken a more cautious approach: Last week, many counties in California had received approval to reopen businesses, including retail shops and restaurants as permitted in the second phase of his plan to restart the state economy. Churches are not allowed to reopen until the plan’s third phase. The approach has angered opponents who claim that California’s rules to stop the spread of the virus violate religious freedoms. Many had announced they would violate the state order and hold in-person services next Sunday. A Pentecostal church in San Diego sued to reopen immediately, but lost its appeal on Friday when the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld Newsom’s ban on in-person services. In a split ruling, a court panel found that government’s emergency powers override what in normal times would be fundamental constitutional rights. Denver:Restaurants in Colorado can reopen at reduced capacity this week and day camps will be allowed to open next week, Gov. Jared Polis said Monday. Restaurants in spots like El Paso and Routt counties have been allowed to reopen under special approvals by state health officials. Restaurants elsewhere in Colorado will be able open starting Wednesday at 50% of their posted occupancy limit but cannot have more than 50 customers at a time, Polis said. “Diners will have more space between tables and at many restaurants, more opportunities to eat outside. The safest thing anyone can do is stay home whenever possible, but for those who want to shop and dine we want to make sure it can be done as safely as possible,” he said. Polis said children’s day camps and youth sports camps will be able to open on June 1 but residential overnight camps would be closed through June. Hartford: Coronavirus hospitalizations in Connecticut increased slightly on Sunday, with five new admissions making for a total of 706, according to state data released Monday. The state reported 49 new deaths from the disease on Sunday and 405 new positive tests. All three numbers are still far below peak levels reached in mid-April. In all, more than 40,800 people in Connecticut have tested positive for COVID-19 and 3,742 have died. The state on Monday closed several parks to additional traffic for the Memorial Day holiday because parking lots had reached capacity under social distancing guidelines. They included Sleeping Giant State Park in Hamden, Paugussett State Forest in Newtown and Wadsworth Falls State Park in Middletown. Wilmington:Gov. John Carney has lifted Delaware’s temporary ban on short-term rentals and the requirement for out-of-state travelers to quarantine for 14 days. Outdoor gatherings of up to 250 people, including weddings and ceremonies, will also be allowed in the coming week, the governor said Tuesday. Cloth face coverings must be worn and people must stand 6 feet apart. These are the latest restrictions the governor has eased up on as Delaware plans to restart parts of its economy in the coming week. Like the reopening of restaurants and businesses, these latest announcements take effect June 1. Carney will also lift the state’s stay-at-home order on June 1, though he cautioned people in a news release to “continue to avoid unnecessary outings and gatherings to limit community spread of COVID-19.” Organizers who want to hold a large, outdoor event can apply by submitting a plan to Delaware Division of Small Business at least seven days before the event. Delaware beaches and boardwalks fully reopened for Memorial Day weekend, the unofficial start of summer. At the time, only Delawareans and nonresidents who completed the mandatory quarantine were allowed to take advantage of the sandy beaches. Washington:As the city looks to begin its initial phase of reopening Friday, Mayor Muriel Bowser announced the addition of two new testing sites in the District, WUSA-TV reported. A new testing site on 2241 Martin Luther King Jr. Ave. in Southeast will replace United Medical Center’s testing site as an accessible alternative. And a new walk-up testing site on 5th Street Northwest between F and G streets will begin operating June 1. Although data showed a spike in cases last weekend, the city has seen 13 days of sustained decline. Bowser said if the trend continues, the District could report 14 days of decline Wednesday. The city will then provide the next steps for its initial phase of reopening. The District will continue to follow the science and reopen when data show the city can, Bowser said. Tallahassee:With customers losing jobs and employees facing health threats, Gulf Power saw a drop in payments for electric service in April as it also spent money to try to prevent the spread of COVID-19, a regulatory filing showed. Gulf, the largest utility in Northwest Florida, said it received about $6 million less in customer bill payments in April than it ordinarily would have collected during the month. About $2.1 million is considered “bad debt,” up from the historical average for April of about $300,000, the company said Friday in the filing at the Florida Public Service Commission. Gulf, like other utilities in the state and country, suspended electric-service disconnections in March as the pandemic caused businesses to shut down or scale back and unemployment to skyrocket. But the filing offers a glimpse of how the economic problems have played out in electric service, something that affects most Florida residents and businesses. It also raises the possibility that Gulf could try to recoup the money when it seeks revised base electric rates, a process that is expected to start in 2021. The filing Friday dealt with an accounting process for bad debt and COVID-19 expenses of the utility. Atlanta: The Georgia Army National Guard continued a recent string of honorary flyovers Monday, with two featuring UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters, one in metro Atlanta and one in coastal and southwest Georgia. The formations hovered over sites with military significance, as well as large hospitals that have been treating people with COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the new coronavirus. “We will pause for a few moments this day to recognize the sacrifice of our service members and our families,” Maj. Gen. Tom Carden said. “It is part of our culture to remember and to honor, and it is going to take more than a global pandemic to change that part of us.” Over the holiday weekend, the Georgia Department of Natural Resources continued to report that it was limiting entrance at some state parks to reduce crowding and possible disease transmission. Local parks and beaches also reported a crowded weekend. The throngs had fallen slightly at Tybee Island, where bumper-to-bumper traffic was reported entering the island for the long weekend. WTOC-TV reported 11,000 cars entered the island Friday, and more than 13,000 on Saturday. Some drivers reported spending an hour trying to find a parking spot. Honolulu: The University of Hawaii said the SAT and ACT will be optional for applicants for the fall 2021 semester as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. The exemption for the two standardized entrance exams is only for students applying to enter the university for the 2021-22 academic year, The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reported Monday. Applicants to the University of Hawaii-Manoa campus can still submit standardized test scores if they desire. The University of Hawaii-Hilo and University of Hawaii-West Oahu do not rely on the SAT or ACT as major criteria for admission. University of Hawaii community colleges do not require the tests for admission. The College Board testing organization canceled SAT exams scheduled for May and June, when many high school juniors would usually take the test. Boise: Ramping up COVID-19 testing and tracing is key to Idaho’s containment strategy, Gov. Brad Little said Friday, as authorities said they hope to be consistently testing 2% of the state’s population in the coming months. “The whole goal of this is to scale up testing with tracing where we can do what Idaho likes to do in a good fire season, and that is get on those fires early and put them out,” Little said at a news conference where a task force released recommendations for expanding testing in the state. The state has in the past weeks struggled to increase testing. Elke Shaw-Telloch, Idaho Department of Health and Welfare administrator for public health, said federal officials recommend testing 2% of the population each month. She said Idaho has been sent 40,000 swabs and other testing materials for May, and it expects the same amount in June. Shaw-Telloch said the state public health lab can run 200 COVID-19 tests a day, and the Veterans Administration can accommodate non VA-patient testing for urgent cases. And she said the Federal Emergency Management Agency has helped deploy point-of-care testing units in Idaho to every health district in the state. Chicago: The chief judge of federal courts in Northern Illinois said things will look “quite different” as some operations resume at courthouses in Chicago and Rockford. Judge Rebecca Pallmeyer said in a video message released Monday that a task force has been planning for how courts can proceed safely during the coronavirus pandemic. Federal courthouses have been largely empty since mid-March. One emergency judge has been on duty at the Dirksen Federal Building in downtown Chicago each day, but most court proceedings have been conducted by paper filings, telephone or video. Under a court order, most hearings were rescheduled for after June 1 and trials were ordered rescheduled for June 29 or later. Pallmeyer said in her video message that the task force has been working with public health officials to determine the safest way to screen visitors entering the courthouse, sanitize facilities and resume jury trials. She didn’t say when jury trials will resume, but said the focus will be on scheduling criminal trials that have been delayed the longest amount of time. Pallmeyer said emergency judges have handled over 500 motions since the pandemic started in Illinois. Since March 18, attorneys have filed more than 7,200 motions, judges have entered 34,200 orders and more than 1,350 new civil cases have been filed, she said. Terre Haute: Three inmates have tested positive for COVID-19 at the federal prison complex in Terre Haute, according to the federal government. The U.S. Bureau of Prisons’ coronavirus website showed that as of Monday, three inmates but no staffers have tested positive for COVID-19 at the U.S. Penitentiary, which is the maximum security prison at the Federal Correctional Complex. That website showed that no deaths from the respiratory disease caused by the new coronavirus have occurred at the western Indiana prisons complex that’s located about 70 miles west of Indianapolis, the Tribune-Star reported. Nationwide, the website showed that there have been 59 federal inmate deaths but no prison staff member deaths attributed to COVID-19 disease. But 1,556 federal inmates and 175 Bureau of Prisons staffers have confirmed positive test results for COVID-19, according to the website. As of Monday, 3,144 inmates and 414 staff have recovered from the virus. The Bureau of Prisons has 136,968 federal inmates in Bureau of Prisons-managed institutions and 12,109 in community-based facilities. The federal agency has about 36,000 staff members. Iowa City: Gov. Kim Reynolds said Tuesday she will lift a moratorium on evictions and allow gatherings of more than 10 people to resume as she continues to ease restrictions meant to stop the spread of the new coronavirus. Reynolds also said she would also allow casinos, amusement parks, speedways, arcades and bowling alleys to reopen in the coming days. Large gatherings for social functions and sports competitions will also be allowed to resume, she said. Advocates for low-income tenants have warned that scores of tenants who have lost income during the pandemic could soon face eviction. The American Civil Liberties Union and several other groups had asked the governor to extend the moratorium of eviction proceedings for nonpayment of rent that she imposed on March 19. Some landlords, however, had reported that they were struggling financially as renters stopped paying amid skyrocketing levels of unemployment. Reynolds said Tuesday the moratorium was a temporary public health measure designed to keep people in their homes. She said the Iowa Finance Authority would announce the details of a new federally-funded program this week to prevent evictions and foreclosures, including the eligibility criteria to receive assistance. Topeka: Dr. Lee Norman, Secretary of the Kansas Department of Health and Environment, urged Kansans who joined large gatherings at Missouri’s Lake of the Ozarks during the Memorial Day weekend to self-quarantine for 14 days to prevent spreading the new coronavirus. Social media posts showed large crowds at pools, bars and restaurants near the lake without any social distancing or masks. “The reckless behavior displayed during this weekend risks setting our community back substantially for the progress we’ve already made in slowing the spread of COVID-19,” Norman said. “If you traveled to Lake of the Ozarks over the weekend, we urge you to act responsibly and self-quarantine to protect your neighbors, coworkers and family.” Officials in Kansas City and St. Louis have also urged residents who were at the gatherings to self-quarantine for 14 days. St. Louis County Executive Sam Page asked the county’s health department to issue a travel advisory for the lake, which draws thousands of visitors every summer. Lexington: The University of Kentucky will use portions of its contingency fund to save nearly 100 school jobs in the next fiscal year amid continuing furloughs at the school, the university’s president said in a news release. The announcement came as 100 additional academic employees were furloughed Friday, about a month after the university furloughed nearly 1,700 academic and UK HealthCare employees because of revenue shortfalls related to the coronavirus outbreak. Many of the 700 furloughed health care workers have returned to work as the number of patients going to the hospital system has increased, the news release said. The money in the contingency fund largely came from savings the school made after it cut back on employee’s retirement funds, the Lexington Herald-Leader reported. According to the news outlet, school officials continue to predict a $70 million shortfall for the budget beginning in July, largely because of a drop in enrollment. Graduate students who work at the university will not lose their jobs because of budget cuts, according to the release. The school will also portion off $250,000 from the student emergency fund specifically for graduate students. New Orleans: City officials are sounding the alarm after data from neighborhood testing showed that the city’s Hispanic community is being disproportionately infected with the new coronavirus. The city’s health director, Jennifer Avegno, said that officials had analyzed the roughly 5,000 tests that had been done at testing sites in recent weeks in partnership with Louisiana State University and LCMC Health. They found that about 3% of blacks and whites who got tested were positive for the virus. But of Hispanics who got tested, more than 20% were positive. They compared their data with other groups such as Ochsner, which had started a mobile testing site and found that they were seeing similar results. Avegno said so far the death rate doesn’t mirror the infection rate, but she’s concerned that the data they’re seeing within the Hispanic community might be the beginning of a greater problem. Portland: Some summer camps have decided to cancel their seasons, but others are finding a way to operate under new rules designed to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus, a newspaper reported Tuesday. Day camps for Maine children are allowed to open June 1, and overnight camps can open on July 1. Out-of-state campers are required to quarantine, the Portland Press Herald reported. So far, about 14 camps decided to cancel their seasons after seeing the new guidelines or in anticipation of them, Ron Hall, executive director of Maine Summer Camps, told the newspaper. The state has about 270 summer camps. The guidelines for overnight camps would limit the size of gatherings, segregate campers into groups and require health screenings. Slovenski Camps in Raymond will operate under the guidelines, even though the camp will take on debt to do so, said owner Peter Slovenski. “The economics of it will lead us into debt, but we don’t think of it as reopening the economy. We think of it as reopening life,” said Slovenski. “We’ll open, and do the best we can to help the children of Maine reopen their lives.” Ocean City:Photos of a crowded boardwalk in Ocean City fueled conversation throughout the holiday weekend during a time where gatherings of more than 10 people or dining in a restaurant are not permitted. The scene did not elicit praise from Delaware Gov. John Carney. “That looks to me like not the way to do things,” Carney said. “What I saw in Rehoboth, and what I heard is the situation along the Delaware coast, is the way to do it.” Carney was likely referring to the decision to open Delaware beaches and community pools under “strict” social distancing guidelines, starting May 22. In past weeks, Ocean City Mayor Rick Meehan’s hope for transition was instead met with crowds. The weekend of May 16-17, when Cruisin week would have been held, still drew car enthusiasts and motorists. That was also the first weekend lodging was reopened by the mayor. Social media posts showed burnouts and other reckless behavior by drivers. Maryland had a 14-day quarantine request for out-of-stater travelers when it was under a stay-at-home order. Gov. Larry Hogan switched to a safer-at-home model May 15. In Ocean City, Meehan said police would not monitor license plates or enforce travel restrictions. Maryland State Police only enforced the stay-at-home order when conducting other business. Boston: The EcoTarium, a science and nature museum in Worcester that closed to the public in March in response to the coronavirus pandemic, is planning to reopen on a limited basis next month. The museum is reopening June 4 only to visitors who purchase tickets in advance, the museum announced Monday on its website. No tickets will be sold to walk-up visitors. Only the paths and trails, ponds and wildlife habitats will be open at first. Buildings, except for the bathrooms, will remain closed. All guests will be required to wear a face mask while on the premises, unless it is medically impossible. The museum will hold an opening for members only on May 30-31. Lansing: A group organizing a ballot drive to add LGBT anti-discrimination protections to Michigan’s civil rights law sued the state Tuesday, saying coronavirus restrictions made it impossible to collect the 340,000 voter signatures needed. Fair and Equal Michigan and two Democratic legislators filed the lawsuit in the state Court of Claims. It seeks an injunction reducing the signature requirement to roughly 127,000 signatures. The suit also challenges deadlines by which signatures must be submitted and asks that signatures that have been collected be able to count in future elections. If the ballot committee is successful, the initiated bill would go to lawmakers and, because the Republican-led Legislature would likely not act, to a public vote in November. The proposal would update the law to prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity in employment, housing and public accommodations. Religion-based discrimination, which already is barred, would be defined to include an individual’s “religious beliefs.” Crookston:The University of Minnesota Crookston’s fourth installment of a six-part series designed to help businesses and communities recover from the COVID-19 pandemic will take place at noon Wednesday. The session will focus on creating strategic partnerships and will feature Deb McGregor, marketing consultant for the Northwest Minnesota Small Business Development Center. McGregor will talk about the importance of strategic partnerships and how businesses can benefit from the right alignments, especially during the pandemic. McGregor will provide context around strategic partnerships including how to identify the right type of partnerships for businesses. She will also provide examples of strategic partnerships that have formed during this time frame. Future installments will follow on the next two Wednesdays, also beginning at noon. The series is a collaboration between UMN Crookston, the Northwest Small Business Development Center in Crookston and Northwest Minnesota Foundation. Although this is a free series, preregistration is recommended; to register visit z.umn.edu/CommunitySeries. Each hour-long session will be recorded. For more information, contact Christine Anderson at caanders@crk.umn.edu or Michelle Christopherson at mchristo@crk.umn.edu. Biloxi: With water parks and amusement parks reopening in Mississippi, visitors at one Gulf Coast attraction said they believed they were safe from coronavirus infection. Margaritaville, which includes an elaborate indoor arcade and rooftop pool, began greeting visitors in Biloxi on Thursday. Other water parks and amusement parks statewide were allowed to reopen Monday, as long as they operated at half capacity of less and met additional requirements for sanitizing and social distancing. “It’s been a great experience so far. We are just glad to be out and have a place welcome us,” Amber Yochim, a visitor from Louisiana, told WLOX-TV. “All the staff are wearing masks. There’s been social distancing in line at the slide and the staff has been great at serving us and getting our food and drinks.” Margaritaville general manager Joe Farruggio said indoor attractions were rearranged. Employees are wearing gloves and masks. “We’ve actually redid the whole floor and we spaced it out quite a bit,” Farruggio said. “That’s the first thing we did. We have social distancing signs probably every 6 feet – they should be 6 feet, just letting them know.” Louisiana resident Kristoffer Arrington said he and his friends wanted to go somewhere they knew the pandemic would be taken seriously. “Louisiana itself, especially New Orleans, is really a hotbed for corona, so we really wanted to get away. I know it’s a lot of people here still, but just out of that state just because I know how bad it is there,” Arrington said. Springfield:The school district is changing how it distributes grab-and-go meals this summer but will add enough food to cover the weekend. Children under age 18 will be able to eat school meals, at no cost to the family, for up to seven days a week. Superintendent John Jungmann said the district is expanding the amount of food it will provide this summer because of the coronavirus pandemic. Each summer, the district participates in a federal program that provides meals to any child, age 18 or younger. However, because summer courses are online in June because of the pandemic, they will be available as grab-and-go. “We will be fewer sites but we’ll actually expand the number of meals,” Jungmann said. “We’ll be providing weekend meals also.” Through July 31, the grab-and-go meals will be provided from 10 a.m. to noon each Monday, Wednesday and Friday. “Kids and parents will just have the ability to pick up multiple days of meals at one time instead of having to come every day,” he said. Billings: A Yellowstone County woman in her 80s has died of COVID-19, the county’s health department said Tuesday. The woman died Monday at a Billings hospital, RiverStone Health announced. She is the 17th person in the state to die of the respiratory virus and the third in the county. John Felton, the county’s health officer, extended sympathies to the woman’s family and friends. Her name has not been released. “This death serves as a very unfortunate reminder about the seriousness of this pandemic,” he said in a statement. “We must continue to take measures to protect them from this disease.” Montana’s last confirmed COVID-19 death happened on April 28, also in Yellowstone County. There have been no new cases among the more than 3,000 tests run in the five days from Thursday through Monday. Gov. Steve Bullock has announced plans for the second phase of reopening the economy to begin on June 1, with increased capacity at bars and restaurants and a lifting of the 14-day quarantine for out-of-state travelers. Omaha: An eighth resident at a western Omaha nursing home has died from COVID-19, as Nebraska health officials reported three new deaths and 145 news cases of the virus. The Life Care Center of Elkhorn in Omaha reported its latest death on Sunday, along with news that eight residents of the care center who had previously tested negative for the virus have now tested positive, the Omaha World-Herald reported. The facility said last week that it would retest all residents who initially tested negative on May 11. The new test results bring the number of residents and former residents who have tested positive to 68, and the facility said in a news release that 55 residents are being treated for COVID-19 symptoms at the nursing home. Seven are being treated at local hospitals. Of 140 center employees tested for the new coronavirus since April 27, 30 have tested positive, with five having recovered and returned to work. The state’s online coronavirus tracking site said the three new deaths Sunday brings the state’s total deaths since the outbreak began to 150. A total of 12,134 people have tested positive for the virus in Nebraska. Carson City:The Trump administration is warning Nevada’s Democratic governor that his plan for reopening the state during recovery from the coronavirus fails to treat religious and secular gatherings equally. In a letter sent Monday to Gov. Steve Sisolak, the head of the Justice Department’s civil rights division took issue with the first phase of Sisolak’s guidelines for restarting economic and social activity in the state. That phased-in reopening restricts the size of in-person worship services, while allowing restaurants and other secular establishments to reopen with less stringent occupancy restrictions, the federal official said. “We understand these directives were issued in the midst of an uncertain situation, which may have required quick decisions based on changing information,” Assistant Attorney General Eric Dreiband wrote to Sisolak. ”We are concerned, however, that the flat prohibition against ten or more persons gathering for in-person worship services – regardless of whether they maintain social distancing guidelines – impermissibly treats religious and nonreligious organizations unequally.” Dreiband last week sent a similar warning letter alleging discriminatory treatment in California, where Gov. Gavin Newsom later released guidelines for resuming in-person religious services in his state. The letter to Sisolak came three days after President Donald Trump declared houses of worship essential during the pandemic and vowed to try to override governors who don’t abide by his call to permit religious organizations to resume in-person services. A spokeswoman for Nevada Attorney General Aaron Ford did not immediately respond to requests for comment about the Justice Department letter. Concord: The New Hampshire chapter of the National Endowment for the Humanities has distributed $400,000 to libraries, historical societies, museums and cultural nonprofit groups struggling financially because of the coronavirus pandemic. New Hampshire Humanities allocated the federal funding to 64 organizations in about 50 communities. Grants to libraries accounted for just over 40% of the total. Brittany Overton, director of the Minot-Sleeper Library in Bristol, said the money will help bridge the town’s digital divide. Trenton: New Jersey schools can hold outdoor graduation ceremonies starting July 6, Gov. Phil Murphy said Tuesday. Murphy, a Democrat, announced the latest relaxation of COVID-19 restrictions in a tweet before his regular news conference on the outbreak. “To the class of 2020, I am proud to say that you will have your opportunity to join with your classmates and families to celebrate your graduation,” Murphy said at the news conference. The events must be held outside and adhere to social-distancing guidelines, Murphy said. It’s possible such restrictions will mean that graduation ceremonies must occur over a couple of days, he said. It’s not clear yet how many people will be permitted to attend the ceremonies, he said, but added that the state education and higher education departments will issue guidance on Wednesday. Schools are closed through June because of the outbreak, but this is the latest easing of restrictions, which have included opening parks and golf courses along with the state’s beaches. Santa Fe:The New Mexico Department of Health and the State Personnel Office began accepting applications Friday to fill 200 to 250 contact-tracing positions around the state as the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic moves into the next phase. The positions range from entry-level through supervisory. Work will be done remotely, and hiring will be done virtually. Qualifications include experience in a health-related field or work with communities on social service matters, social work or case management. Those hired will work with approximately 150 Health Department personnel already engaged in contact tracing, many of whom have been temporarily reassigned from other public health roles in the department. Those hired will be assigned to one of five regional contact-tracing teams statewide, with larger teams deployed to the regions with higher numbers of cases. Additional positions are likely to become available over the summer as New Mexico continues to increase contact-tracing capacity. The goal is to ensure that every individual who tests positive for COVID-19 is identified, isolated, monitored and supported through the isolation period and that all known contacts are also contacted, tested for COVID-19 and monitored. New York City: New Yorkers marked Memorial Day with car convoys and small ceremonies instead of big parades as the coronavirus pandemic reshaped the solemn holiday, blending tributes to virus victims and front-line workers with the traditional remembrance of the nation’s war dead. In a year that marks the 75th anniversary of the end of World War II, veterans wore masks and saluted while standing at social-distancing intervals at observances shrunk by virus precautions. At the Intrepid Sea, Air & Space Museum in Manhattan – the former aircraft carrier USS Intrepid – Gov. Andrew Cuomo honored veterans and essential workers on a Memorial Day he called “especially poignant and powerful.” “We know something about loss, and we’re living it again,” the Democratic governor said. In Rochester, officials looked ahead to the construction of the city’s War on Terror Memorial. In Long Island’s Nassau County, a small group of veterans in masks saluted flag-bedecked vehicles at a car parade and wreath-laying that was closed to the public but streamed online. In Brooklyn, about 30 to 40 cars, including an old-style checkered cab, rode along the route usually covered by marchers at the United Military Veterans of Kings County parade. They finished by circling a Veterans Affairs hospital, many honking their horns, and laying a wreath near monuments at the hospital’s fence. Southport: A coastal town in North Carolina has installed hand sanitizer stations on sidewalks in its downtown. The Charlotte Observer reported that that the town of Southport announced the move on Saturday as crowds traveled to the North Carolina coast for Memorial Day weekend. “One of the interventions we can do as a city is to supply masks and we’re also placing hand sanitizer stations around the city,” Southport Mayor Joseph Hatem said in a YouTube video. Health experts have long recommended that people sanitize their hands to avoid contracting the new coronavirus. Bismarck: State health officials on Tuesday reported 43 new cases of COVID-19, including 38 in the state’s most populous county that contains Fargo. Statewide, there were 2,422 confirmed cases as of Tuesday. Cass County has recorded 1,580 of the confirmed cases. North Dakota has recorded 54 deaths linked to the new coronavirus but none was reported Tuesday. The number of patients hospitalized was 40 on Tuesday, up one from the previous day. The state Department of Health said the testing lab recently experienced a recent malfunction of two pieces of equipment, so 82 positive results have been considered inconclusive and the individuals have been asked to retest. The malfunction has been corrected and has not impacted lab processing, officials said. Officials said retesting is ongoing over the next “couple of days.” Sixty-five people have been retested, with one positive case. One person has refused to be retested, officials said. Columbus: A federal court panel temporarily stopped Ohio ballot campaigns Tuesday from proceeding under less restrictive signature-gathering rules they had been granted amid the coronavirus pandemic. A three-judge panel of the 6th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals stayed the more flexible rules while the state fights a lower court judge’s May 19 decision setting them up. U.S. District Court Judge Edmund Sargus Jr. had allowed campaigns promoting minimum wage, voting rights and marijuana issues to collect signatures electronically. He also extended the deadline for submitting signatures to July 31. Sargus stopped short of reducing the number of signatures required, as some courts elsewhere have done amid a spate of COVID-19-related signature-gathering challenges. Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost appealed Sargus’ decision Thursday on behalf of fellow Republican Frank LaRose, the secretary of state. Yost asked the full Sixth Circuit to take up the case en banc. The state argued, among other things, that “wet ink” signature requirements laid out in Ohio’s Constitution cannot be changed without a vote of the people. The case has been expedited. The ruling adds to a string of setbacks for Ohioans for Safe and Secure Elections, whose reform package aims to make voting in Ohio easier. Campaign manager Toni Webb lamented Tuesday’s ruling in an emailed statement. Oklahoma City: A city-based hospital system on Tuesday began allowing limited visitation to most patients, including those with the new coronavirus, as the state continues to reopen. Integris Health said some patients can designate one person as a “patient representative” who can visit between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m. daily. Patients in obstetrics, pediatrics and neonatal intensive care can have two representatives, but no visitors will be allowed for patients in isolation except for those near death. The representative must be 18 or older and follow hospital health safety rules that include hand washing and wearing masks. The statement did not address whether the visitors would be allowed to touch the patients or if social distancing guidelines would be enforced, and a spokesperson did not immediately return phone calls for comment. Gov. Kevin Stitt’s reopening plan allows the patient representatives in hospitals “subject to any screening procedures required by the facility including temperature screenings, observance of hand hygiene practices, and the wearing of their own mask at all times while in the facility.” The policy is considered strict and likely will remain so “because we have the most vulnerable health population in the state,” said Dr. David Chansolme, medical director of infection prevention at Integris.“These are the sickest people,” with the least immunity to infection, Chansolme said. The hospital’s waiting rooms and common areas will remain closed. Portland: A rural Oregon judge said he won’t dismiss his ruling which tossed out Gov. Kate Brown’s stay-at-home orders to fight the spread of the coronavirus. The Oregonian/OregonLive reported that Baker County Circuit Judge Matthew B. Shirtcliff told the state Supreme Court on Tuesday he will not alter the preliminary injunction that declared Brown’s directives “null and void.? The Supreme Court last week stayed Shirtcliff’s original ruling. “I have elected to stand by my original ruling,? the judge wrote to attorneys involved in the case. ” I will not be vacating the May 18, 2020 Order Granting Preliminary Injunctive Relief and Denying Motion to Dismiss or taking other action.? The state Supreme Court will now accept further legal briefs until June 2 before it decides whether it should uphold or dismiss Shirtcliff’s preliminary injunction. The governor had won an emergency stay, meaning a hold on the injunction, allowing her executive “Stay Home Save Lives? orders to remain in effect, until the state Supreme Court hears the merits of the case. The state has until Thursday to file further briefing in support of its push to dismiss Shirtcliff’s injunction, and the 10 churches and 21 others who sought the injunction will have until next Tuesday to respond. Philadelphia: City officials on Tuesday began removing dozens of people who have been sleeping at the airport during the coronavirus pandemic, and they plan to administer rapid COVID-19 tests before taking them to homeless shelters. Officials at Philadelphia International Airport had initially planned Friday to remove the 50 to 100 homeless people who have been sleeping at a baggage claim area underused during stay-at-home orders. But airport and city officials agreed to wait until Tuesday after advocates threatened to sue if the people were moved to shelters without being tested. City Manager Brian Abernathy said Friday that Delaware County officials also would be on hand Tuesday to offer to take people to shelters in the neighboring county. He said arrangements were in place to house anyone who wanted to go to a shelter. The airport began enforcing new rules Tuesday, allowing only workers and those with airport business in the terminals and baggage areas. The Philadelphia Inquirer reported Thursday that homeless advocates were concerned about people being moved from the airport without being tested for the virus and the possibility that they could take the illness into shelters. Newport: The City Council is expected to consider a resolution this week that would go beyond state rules and mandate mask-wearing at all hours on some city streets. The measure introduced by Councilwoman Susan Taylor, if passed at a special meeting Wednesday, would go into effect Friday, WJAR-TV reported. Under Raimondo’s executive order enacted earlier this month, anyone in a public place has to wear a face covering if it’s not possible to maintain a 6-foot distance from others. Newport’s proposal goes a step further, requiring all pedestrians to wear masks on some busy downtown streets that get lots of foot traffic whether social distancing can be maintained or not. The resolution is meant to keep people healthy as more residents emerge from their homes during the nicer weather, and more people visit the city. Columbia: Coronavirus-related changes to this year’s South Carolina primary elections, including universal absentee voting, mean that elections officials are expecting a high volume of absentee ballots, as well as possibly a long wait for results. On Monday, a federal judge temporarily nixed a policy requiring absentee voters obtain the signature of a witness, saying that having to seek a witness increases the chance that a voter would contract or spread the new coronavirus. Ordering South Carolina officials not to enforce the requirement, U.S. District Judge J. Michelle Childs wrote that “adherence to the witness requirement in June would only increase the risk for contracting COVID-19 for members of the public with underlying medical conditions, the disabled, and racial and ethnic minorities.” Childs’ order is the second recent move to ease voting in South Carolina amid the outbreak. Earlier this month, Gov. Henry McMaster signed a law allowing anyone to get an absentee ballot without an excuse for the June 9 primary. Both the narrowly tailored law and the lifting of the signature requirement apply only to the primaries and, if needed, runoff elections that would follow two weeks later. State lawmakers have said they will consider in the summer or early fall if changes need to be made for November’s general elections. Sioux Falls: South Dakota health officials reported 67 new cases of COVID-19 on Tuesday but no new deaths in the state tied to the pandemic. Although Minnehaha County, the state’s most populated area, has accounted for the bulk of cases statewide and an outbreak at a Smithfield pork processing plant that infected more than 800 employees, several other counties have seen a significant number of cases in recent days. Beadle County reported the highest number Tuesday with 18. Outbreaks at other meat processing plants have fueled the rise in cases in some of those counties. The DemKota Ranch Beef plant in Aberdeen has reported 147 cases among employees, and 58 employees of a Jack Link’s plant in Alpena have tested positive for the virus. Employees at the Dakota Provisions poultry plant in Huron have also tested positive, but the Department of Health does not release case counts for a specific employer until they reach over 40. Nashville:State lawmakers marked their return to legislative offices Tuesday by advancing an anti-transgender proposal after abruptly recessing three months ago because of the coronavirus outbreak. In March, lawmakers scrambled to approve a newly designed 2020-21 fiscal year budget back when the virus outbreak was just emerging in Tennessee – leaving hundreds of bills in limbo – but promised to formally return on June 1. House members, however, decided to gather this week and hold legislative committee meetings on a wide variety of bills – many of which were not directly related to COVID-19. This included a proposal dictating that Tennessee elementary and high school students could only play sports based on the sex identified on their birth certificates. The bill is one of two proposals being considered in the GOP-dominated Statehouse involving transgender students and what sports teams they can play on. The proposal advanced out of a subcommittee on a voice vote with only person voting in opposition. It must still face the full House Education Committee and House floor. However, even if the bill clears those hurdles, it’s unclear how much success it would have in the Senate. The Senate’s only scheduled meeting this week is a briefing on the state’s revenues affected by the economic fallout of the virus. This has resulted in a stark difference between the House and Senate on what issues will be considered over the next coming weeks. Austin:House Speaker Nancy Pelosi will be a headliner of Texas Democrats’ virtual convention, which was moved online over fears of the new coronavirus. The announcement Tuesday gives Texas Democrats one of their most prominent convention speakers in recent years. Democrats have been shut out of power at the Texas Capitol for nearly two decades but need just nine seats to flip the Texas House for the first time since 2003. The virtual convention begins Monday. Democrats had originally booked San Antonio’s convention center but moved the party gathering online as coronavirus cases began to climb in Texas in March. Texas Republicans are still planning to hold their convention in-person in Houston in July. Logan: Restrictions aimed at reducing the use of single-use plastic bags have been put on hold in northern Utah during the coronavirus pandemic, but officials close to the issue said the efforts will not be forgotten. In response to COVID-19, some stores have banned reusable bags as part of their safety measures because they are believed to pose more of a risk in spreading the virus than plastic bags, The Herald Journal reported. “The very thing that we were promoting as a big part of the solution is now banned,” said Richmond Mayor Jeff Young, who has extensively reviewed the bag issue as Cache County Solid Waste Advisory Board chairman. “I actually think that we’re going to have to go back to the drawing board and re-discuss stuff that we now know that we didn’t know a few months ago when we were discussing this.” The board drafted a plan last year to work with retailers and residents to reduce lightweight, single-use plastic bags, which have contributed to pollution concerns worldwide. The plan included a public-education program and working with retailers to formulate their own reduction measures and policies. The Logan Municipal Council then passed a ban on plastic bags to speed up the board’s plan. The ban was scheduled to take effect in April if the board failed to act before then, but it was reversed earlier this year. Burlington: A nonprofit group that protects public access to some swimming holes in Vermont’s rivers and streams is urging people who use them to be safe. The advice from The Vermont River Conservancy, which works to protect land along the state’s waterways, comes as the state is getting its first dose of extended hot, summer weather. The conservancy said that the swimming holes it protects will have signs by the organization that says people shouldn’t visit if they are sick, avoid areas that do not allow a minimum 6-foot distance, urges swimmers not to linger too long and to make space for others. The conservancy said people should not wear a mask while swimming, but they should wear masks along the trails to and from the swimming holes. Executive Director Steve Libby said the swimming holes are places to enjoy on a hot day where people can recharge during unsettling times. “We rely strongly on the respectful behavior of visitors to ensure these sites can remain open during the pandemic, and are cared for and maintained for years to come,” he said in a news release posted to the organization’s website. Richmond: Local governments across the state are set to start receiving their first share of federal funding designated to cover spending related to the coronavirus pandemic. Virginia got about $3.1 billion from the federal CARES Act and opted to give half to localities with fewer than 500,000 people, The Virginian-Pilot reported. A little less than half of what has been set aside for the cities and counties should be paid around June 1. Finance Secretary Aubrey Layne told the newspaper this round of funding was allocated based on the locality’s proportion of the statewide population. Layne said the other half of the money set aside for local governments could be allocated a different way the next time - based on the number of positive coronavirus cases, for example. Cities and counties can use the money only for certain expenses, not to make up for lost tax revenue. The funding could be used to help pay for projects such as establishing temporary medical facilities, providing COVID-19 testing, performing contact tracing and facilitating distance learning. Fairfax County, the only jurisdiction in the state with more than a half-million residents, had to seek its own funding and got about $200 million. Vancouver: The number of employees at a Vancouver fruit processing facility who have tested positive for COVID-19 is now up to 65. KGW reported that Firestone Pacific Foods said 87 employees have tested negative for the virus, and there are still a few of its employees who need to be tested. The company said there are no known hospitalizations involving its workers. The outbreak was first discovered on May 17 when an employee tested positive for the new coronavirus. After learning of the positive test, the company shut down its production facility, but the number of workers known to be infected with COVID-19 has continued to grow. As of May 22, the number of employees who had tested positive was at 38. Clark County Public Health is working with the plant to get all its roughly 150 employees tested and make sure guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is being followed. Charleston: The state’s Board of Law Examiners will go ahead with the bar examination this summer, with policies worked out with government and medical experts amid the coronavirus pandemic.The dates for the exam are July 28-29. It will be given at the Charleston Coliseum and Convention Center. Applicants, administrators and proctors can be screened before entering the site, with applicants not allowed to enter if their temperature is 100.4 degrees or higher, according to a news release from the state Supreme Court.Applicants will have to be 6 feet apart when in line to enter or exit and during the exam. Only one applicant will sit at each table. Applicants, administrators and proctors also must wear masks. Anyone traveling to West Virginia from out of state for the exam may be required to quarantine for 14 days before the exam, based on an executive order issued in March. Madison: State courts can resume in-person hearings and jury trials if they can come up with plans to protect participants and observers from the new coronavirus, under an order from a divided state Supreme Court. The Supreme Court in March suspended in-person hearings and jury trials, ordering judges to continue trials to a date after May 22. A task force convened by Wisconsin Supreme Court Chief Justice Patience Roggensack and comprised of judges, court clerks and attorneys convened in April. Its recommendations released on May 15 included calls for participants and spectators to wear face masks, observe social distancing standards and use hand sanitizers, and clerks to include a note in jury summons detailing the precautions the court has taken. The Supreme Court issued an order Friday evening that allows individual municipal and circuit courts to resume in-person proceedings, including jury trials, on a county-by-county basis if the courts prepare a plan to do so safely. Each plan must mandate face masks for everyone in the courtroom, although a judge can allow a witness to testify without one, spell out practices for cleaning frequently touched surfaces, and require courthouse signs directing people to hand sanitizer. The chief judge of each judicial administrative district must approve the plans before proceedings can resume. The chief judge’s signature would invalidate the Supreme Court’s suspensions and allow hearings and trials to resume in the local court that submitted the plan. Cody: Results are negative so far during testing for signs of the new coronavirus in sewage. Park County Public Health officer Dr. Aaron Billin presented the first round of results to Cody city officials Monday. The samples were taken April 28 at the city’s wastewater treatment center. Billin said the results are encouraging and show that local public health efforts have been successful. Health officials plan two more rounds of tests this month to establish baseline data before more tourists visiting nearby Yellowstone National Park begin to arrive in Cody, the Cody Enterprise reported. More tests will follow throughout the summer. The samples go to BioBot Analytics, a wastewater epidemiology company based in Somerville, Massachusetts. Park County Public Health is paying for the program with state and federal funding."
74,74,Apple and Google team up on coronavirus tracking technologyJefferson Graham ,"Apr. 13, 2020",https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2020/04/10/coronavirus-apple-and-google-covid-19-contact-tracking/5131508002/,"Tech giants Apple and Google have teamed up on Contact Tracing, technology that can help people figure out if they've been exposed to COVID-19, via apps and Bluetooth technology. According to Google, Contact Tracing ""makes it possible to combat the spread of the COVID-19 virus by alerting participants of possible exposure to someone who they have recently been in contact with, and who has subsequently been positively diagnosed as having the virus."" The app lets you know if the other person you were in contact with has been diagnosed with COVID, and recommends self-quarantine in response. At the same time, in a joint news release, the companies says ""user privacy and security"" are central to the design and that they will launch software tools and operating system technology to assist researchers. Heartbreaking:From six to 95 years old, these are survivors of coronavirus Health:Doctor's deep breathing trick helps keep COVID-19 symptoms from worsening In May, both Apple and Google will release what are called APIs, software tools that allow developers to create within the operating systems, that will be interoperable between the Apple iOS and Google Android mobile platforms. In turn, the companies expect contact tracing apps to be available for download at the Apple iOS and Google Play app stores. In the ""coming months,"" Apple and Google look to also enable a Bluetooth-based solution as part of the iOS and Android platforms. The companies say this would allow more people to participate ""as well as enable interaction with a broader ecosystem of apps and government health authorities."" On Twitter, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said their contact tracing would have ""strong controls and protections for user privacy."" In his tweet, Apple CEO Tim Cook said contact tracing could be done ""without compromising user privacy.""  In March, President Donald Trump caught Google by surprise by announcing that the company was working with the government on a national website to help people pre-screen for COVID-19.  Google later said it was actually a sister unit within parent company Alphabet, called Verily, which said it would begin a pilot test in the San Francisco Bay area. It has since expanded to Stockton, in the central California valley, Sacramento, the state capitol and Riverside, south of Los Angeles.  Users are pre-screened on the web, and if they meet predetermined criteria, they advance to a drive-up testing facility.  Meanwhile, Apple CEO Tim Cook announced on Twitter that the company had sourced over 20 million protective masks. ""Our design, engineering, operations and packaging teams are also working with suppliers to design, produce and ship face shields for medical workers.""  In a statement, the American Civil Liberties Union applauded the companies for trying to help, but said no contact tracing app can be fully effective ""until there is widespread, free, and quick testing and equitable access to healthcare."" The ACLU said privacy concerns are paramount. ""People will only trust these systems if they protect privacy, remain voluntary, and store data on an individual's device, not a centralized repository.""

75,75,In CA: Thousands to be trained on how to hunt coronavirus infectionsMegan Diskin ,"May 20, 2020",https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/05/20/thousands-trained-how-hunt-coronavirus-infections-weds-news/5228905002/,"Hey friends, I'm Megan Diskin, a justice and equality reporter with the Ventura County Star, and the latest to sub in for Arlene Martinez. Put me in, coach! Speaking of teamwork, it sounds like staff at a Rancho Mirage hospital might be taking inspiration from a gang of superheroes in their fight against COVID-19. The ""Virus Avenger"" was bought by Eisenhower Medical Center to decontaminate hard-to-come-by N95 masks. The Avenger uses ultraviolet light to disrupt the coronavirus' genetic material. It was paid for with donations from the hospital's coronavirus response fund... because medical personnel are the real heroes. Stay safe and informed with news and resources from across the USA TODAY Network and beyond: Sign up for In California today (it's free!). We're all eager for a summer of lounging at the beach and grabbing a meal with loved ones. The governor this week made it somewhat easier for that to happen in all 58 counties when he relaxed the standards for reopening. One of the metrics requires counties to have 15 contact tracers per 100,000 residents. And success there seems to be lagging.  An analysis by the Desert Sun shows more than 40% of counties could not meet that requirement. The tracing and testing metrics assure the state that county health departments can identify cluster outbreaks and halt their web from spreading wider.  To help achieve these goals, state health officials are working to train thousands of people in contact tracing who can be deployed at any time. Newsom calls them his ""army of disease detectives."" A day after the new standards were announced, Tulare County Board of Supervisors voted to reopen businesses and churches immediately. The county was called out by Newsom as one of five counties not expected to meet the requirements, citing nursing home outbreaks.  Local officials pushed back and said the state is to blame for that, since the California Department of Public Health licenses and regulates the state's 1,200 nursing homes. But would the exclusion of those nursing home cases be enough to meet the metrics? Advocates are worried the state is not tracking the virus outbreak in the LGBTQ community as it records groups disproportionately affected. They say many may be more vulnerable to its effects because of the prevalence of HIV and some cancers.  Some may avoid medical care because they fear discrimination, and LGBTQ people are more likely to be homeless.  State Sen. Scott Wiener, D-San Francisco, introduced a bill in February that would require providers ask a person about their sexual orientation and gender identity. People can decline, however.  The proposed legislation, Senate Bill 932, passed the Senate Health Committee last week.  Meanwhile, a photo of a 43-year-old San Francisco nurse depicting severe weight loss after being hospitalized with the virus is going viral. The formerly fit man, with no underlying conditions, didn't think he'd get infected. He was one of about three dozen people likely infected at a Miami LGBTQ festival in early March.  San Diego Gas & Electric employees are so essential, some of them are living in the company's parking lot. Two teams of six employees work 12-hour shifts as grid operators for 14 days.  When the shift is over, they head into recreational vehicles in the parking lot. A pingpong table and basketball hoop have been provided to help pass the time.  These grid operating crews were the first on the West Coast to proactively sequester.  With all that said, maybe my bed turned into office space isn't half bad.  Ten buildings at a laboratory where a partial nuclear meltdown occurred in 1959 are being torn down. It's the first step in the long-delayed cleanup at the Santa Susana Field Laboratory southeast of Simi Valley.  The U.S. Department of Energy announced the agreement with the state Wednesday. The 10 buildings represent some of the most contaminated structures. Research was done there starting in the 1960s and included  processing, packaging and shipment of radioactive and mixed hazardous wastes.  The Los Angeles City Council voted to have city attorneys draft a law capping fees for restaurants partnering with food-delivery service providers.  Apps like GrubHub and Postmates can charge as much as 30% in fees to local eateries, causing some spots to increase their prices. The COVID-19 pandemic has propelled the issue to the forefront as more people (and businesses) rely on these apps.  San Francisco and New York City have done the same.  “Even before the madness, it was just a terrible deal no matter how you slice it,” Anca Caliman, co-owner of Lemon Poppy Kitchen in Glassell Park and Parsnip in Highland Park, told The Los Angeles Times.

76,76,"Rock Hall, Hard Rock resort, full-service gas: News from around our 50 statesFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports ","Jun. 12, 2020",https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/06/12/rock-hall-hard-rock-resort-full-service-gas-news-around-states/111951272/,"Montgomery:Attendants are coming out to gas up cars, clean windshields and even deliver food and drinks from inside at a dozen MAPCO stations nationwide, including one in Montgomery. The station near Publix at Vaughn and Taylor roads is now full-service from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. each day. Customers can pay from their car using a touchless credit card system. It offers online ordering and curbside service through https://www.mapcorewards.com/fullserviceplus. The company said the limited rollout is part of its response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In-store occupancy is now limited to 10 people or less, in-store seating is closed, plexiglass shields have been installed at all registers and the company said employees have been provided masks and are allowed to wear gloves. The only other Alabama locations that have rolled out the service are in Huntsville. The chain has more than 340 locations nationwide. Bethel: Two animal rights groups arranged for a second shipment of dog food to remote Alaska Native villages they said were in dire need of the supplies. The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and the Humane Society of the United States worked together to deliver 8,000 pounds of dog food to Bethel. The need stemmed from the coronavirus pandemic. Supplies were running low after the two groups provided the same amount of dog food in an April shipment. Five pallets of dog food were delivered to the western Alaska hub community. From there, Bethel Friends of Canines will distribute the dog food to rural villages in the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta. Officials said in a release that delivery of dog food to rural Alaska has been challenging during the pandemic because of limited supplies and transportation options. Window Rock: Census workers will resume dropping off questionnaires at homes on the Navajo Nation this week. The tribe’s legislative branch said the work to deliver paper packets to more than 70,000 homes began Thursday. The operation that started in mid-March quickly was suspended because of the coronavirus pandemic. People who receive the packets can fill out the census using the paper forms, by phone or online. The U.S. Census Bureau said its staff has received training in social distancing and workers have protective equipment to do their jobs. The packets are left at homes in areas where most people do not receive mail at a physical address. Navajo Nation Council Speaker Seth Damon urged tribal members to complete the form to ensure an accurate count and to list “Navajo” as the individual tribal affiliation. Census data is collected every 10 years and is used to allocate federal funds that support education, infrastructure and human service expenditures. So far, less than 1% of Navajos have responded on their own, according to the Census Bureau. Little Rock: The state will further ease its coronavirus restrictions on businesses next week, Gov. Asa Hutchinson said Wednesday, despite recent dramatic increases in the state’s active cases and hospitalizations. Hutchinson said the state will move into “Phase 2” of reopening on Monday, allowing restaurants, bars and other businesses that are limited to one-third capacity to expand to two thirds. Arkansas last month began allowing businesses that had closed because of the pandemic to reopen but with capacity limits and other restrictions meant to prevent the virus’ spread. The Republican governor decided to further reopen businesses even with the state in the midst of what he has called a second peak of the outbreak. The number of active cases, meaning ones that don’t include people who have recovered or died, has increased by more than 85% since Memorial Day. Hospitalizations have increased by more than 82% in that same period. “We’re not out of the woods,” Hutchinson said. “We’re still in the heart of the woods when it comes to this health care emergency.” Hutchinson and state health officials said there isn’t any evidence connecting the spike in cases to the decision to reopen businesses. The increase has been driven by a rise in cases in northwest Arkansas, especially in the Latino community. The governor has also said the increase is partly due to increased testing in the state. Sacramento: The state Assembly narrowly passed a proposal on Wednesday that would allow legislators to vote remotely during emergencies, as lawmakers widely regretted not being able to act during a weeks-long recess amid the coronavirus pandemic. The measure comes after other states and cities have relaxed rules to vote remotely during the public health emergency. In California, the Legislature stopped work for the first time in 158 years in the middle of March, before resuming committee meetings in early May. Lawmakers said they need to continue serving and passing budgets during events like major earthquakes and pandemics. The state Senate has until June 25 to approve the proposed constitutional amendment for remote voting by two-thirds vote in order to place it on the November ballot, where voters would have the final say. The measure passed with 54 votes, just enough for a two-thirds majority, and bipartisan backing. But some Republicans who opposed the bill said it should be narrowly tailored to only allow lawmakers to cast a vote remotely, not permit them to use someone else as a proxy vote in the event they cannot attend a session during an emergency. Durango: The Durango & Silverton Narrow Gauge Railroad has announced plans to reopen with limited service trips by the end of the month after shutting down in March because of the coronavirus pandemic. Democratic Gov. Jared Polis eased regulations in the past few weeks, allowing scenic trains to resume operations at 50% capacity, the Durango Herald reported. It is one of the region’s main economic drivers, accounting for about $250 million with more than 200 peak season employees and 100 year-round employees, according to the Durango Chamber of Commerce. It is also a tourist attraction that brings up to 200,000 riders annually from around the world on the 45-mile trek from Durango to Silverton. The company originally said it would only be profitable at 75% capacity, but said it reworked its operations to make 50% financially feasible because it was unlikely it would be allowed to run at a higher capacity. The railroad could start running limited service trips by the last week of June if given approval, which could include shorter trips out of Silverton and reopening the museum and gift shop in Durango. Railroad officials have said they will have to reduce the number of people on each train because of COVID-19 and implement safety measures, such as requiring face masks. Hartford: Attorneys representing patients at two state psychiatric hospitals in Connecticut are asking a judge to require Connecticut Valley Hospital and Whiting Forensic Hospital to take additional steps to stop the spread of the new coronavirus to better protect patients, including reducing the patient populations. They’re also calling for improvements in hygiene and decontamination practices; steps that ensure staff consistently wear masks and patients are encouraged to wear masks; and requiring both hospitals to conform their testing protocols to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention standards. This week, the Connecticut Legal Rights Project and the Judge David L. Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law and Center for Public Representation filed a motion for a preliminary injunction in a class-action lawsuit against the state. They note there have been outbreaks at both hospitals and five patients at Connecticut Valley Hospital have died from COVID-19, while the state has confirmed 73 cases among patients and 64 among staff at both facilities. A spokeswoman for the state Department of Mental Health and Addiction Service said the agency was not able to comment on pending litigation. Wilmington:Now that outdoor gatherings of up to 250 people are allowed by the state, schools are starting to rethink in-person graduation ceremonies. School districts are creatively coming up with plans to celebrate seniors and prevent the spread of COVID-19. In the Christina School District, high schools opted for an outdoor event, giving students the opportunity to walk across a stage. Dressed in graduation garb in their decorated cars, Capital High School graduates took a victory lap around Dover International Speedway, receiving their diplomas through the car window. For students at Sussex Tech, groups of teachers paraded through the county to drop off items like senior T-shirts, graduation caps and gowns and yard signs. And in communities across Delaware, neighbors have organized their own graduation parades to give students an in-person event as several districts hold virtual ceremonies. Other school districts continue to roll out graduation plans for the coming weeks. In most cases, students are split into staggered groups to accommodate the 250-person rule. Washington: After more than a month of decline in deaths, the District has been on a slight upward trend for the past three days. The daily numbers remain far below where they were in early and mid-May, however. On Wednesday, DC Health reported 63 new cases and four new deaths, bringing the city’s totals to 9,537 and 499, respectively. Hollywood: The Seminole Hard Rock Hotel & Casino said it will open its doors later this week for the first time since March, when coronavirus concerns forced it to close. The casino resort will open Friday with requirements that visitors wear face masks and get temperature checks upon entering. Some table games are being retrofitted with plexiglass shields and gaming chips will be sprayed with a sanitizing solution. Capacity will be limited to 50% and guests and workers are expected to maintain social distancing, according to new guidelines. The resort said all of its properties have been equipped with air purification and disinfecting systems. Meanwhile, Disney officials outlined new hotel protocols as they prepare to reopen Walt Disney World resorts next month. The company said it would devote extra cleaning to high-traffic areas like elevators, escalators, handrails, benches and restrooms. Restaurants and fitness centers will have limits on the number of people allowed in, and cashless options will be emphasized at shops and restaurants, the company said. Atlanta: A Georgia man is accused of falsely claiming that an air purifier he was selling would kill the coronavirus, federal prosecutors said Thursday. Stephen Matthew “Matt” Shumaker of Marietta had postcards sent to thousands of Georgia residents claiming that the Beyond Guardian Air air purifier kills “every known major viral and bacterial infection,” including the coronavirus and COVID-19, according to a sworn statement from a postal inspector filed in federal court in Atlanta. The postcards, which were mailed in March and include a photo of the air purifier, feature a red box with white type that says: “KILL COVID-19, CORONAVIRUS IN YOUR HOME!!” according to a copy included in the postal inspector’s statement. Shumaker, 43, is charged with mail fraud and knowingly distributing and selling a misbranded pesticidal device. Federal prosecutors said Shumaker has been arrested. Online court records did not list an attorney who could comment on the charges. The postal inspector opened the investigation in April after a resident reported receiving a suspicious postcard in the mail. The postal inspector found that the phone number on the card was registered to Pure Life Water Corp, which is run by Shumaker. Hilo: Hawaii County has canceled all sponsored Independence Day festivities because of concerns about spreading the new coronavirus among thousands of attendees, officials said. Mayor Harry Kim said the county’s annual Fourth of July events cannot be safely conducted without risking an additional outbreak of of COVID-19, The Hawaii Tribune-Herald reported Wednesday. County-sponsored events include the Hilo Bay Blast, which provides a day of activities around Hilo Bayfront culminating in a public fireworks display. The cancellation was the “necessary thing to do,” Kim said. “Nobody wanted to have to do this,” Kim said. “But literally thousands of people go to the Bayfront for these events. There’s no way we can ensure that everything will be safe by next month.” Other canceled Big Island holiday events include the Kailua-Kona Fourth of July parade and fireworks and the Parker Ranch Fourth of July rodeo and horse races in Waimea. Kim said he hopes some of the events can be rescheduled for later in the year when concerns about the spread of the virus have eased. Boise: Gov. Brad Little said Idaho can move to the fourth and final stage of his plan to return to regular activity during the coronavirus pandemic despite a bump in infections, including among health care workers. The Republican governor said restrictions will be lifted Saturday that will allow gatherings of more than 50 people as long as precautions are taken. Employers can resume unrestricted staffing but should protect workers with physical distancing and other measures. Visits to senior living facilities can resume, but physical distancing and good hygiene should be practiced. The wearing of face coverings should continue when people go out in public. Little’s plan for moving through the four stages is based on infection rates and testing. The readiness of the health care system is another factor, including available ventilators and beds in intensive care units. Little said Thursday that all those factors allowing moving to stage 4 are being met, though it was close on several. Idaho has 3,260 confirmed cases of the virus that have caused 85 deaths, according to a total by Johns Hopkins University on Thursday. Stage 4 is scheduled to end on June 26. Chicago: Surgeons have given a new set of lungs to a young woman with severe lung damage from the new coronavirus. Only a few other COVID-19 survivors, in China and Europe, have received lung transplants. The patient, who is her 20s, was on a ventilator and heart-lung machine for almost two months before her operation June 5 at Northwestern Memorial Hospital. The 10-hour procedure was challenging because the virus had left her lungs full of holes and almost fused to the chest wall, Dr. Ankit Bharat, who performed the operation, said Wednesday. Doctors have kept her on both machines while her body heals but said her chances for a normal life are good. “We are anticipating that she will have a full recovery,” said Dr. Rade Tomic, medical director of the hospital’s lung transplant program. The patient was not identified but Bharat said she had recently moved to Chicago from North Carolina to be with her boyfriend. She was otherwise pretty healthy but her condition rapidly deteriorated after she was hospitalized in late April. Doctors waited six weeks for her body to clear the virus before considering a transplant. Lungs accounted for just 7% of the nearly 40,000 U.S. organ transplants last year. They are typically hard to find and patients often wait weeks on the transplant list. The Chicago patient was in bad shape, with signs that her heart, kidneys and liver were beginning to fail, so she quickly moved up in line, Bharat said. Indianapolis: Movie theaters, bars, museums and amusement parks across the state will be allowed to reopen Friday for the first time in nearly three months, as Gov. Eric Holcomb said he was moving up by two days the next stage of easing the state’s coronavirus restrictions. A new state order will allow social gatherings of up to 250 people and retail stores and malls to operate at full capacity, Holcomb said. Gatherings have been limited to 100 people and stores to 75% capacity for the past three weeks as such limits have been gradually lifted since early May. Restaurants will be allowed 75% capacity in their dining rooms, while bars, nightclubs, movie theaters, bowling alleys, museums and amusement parks can open at half-capacity. Casinos can resume operations starting Monday under safety plans submitted to the Indiana Gaming Commission. Public playgrounds can reopen Friday, but festivals and parades ares still prohibited. This reopening stage had been scheduled for Sunday. Officials said the earlier action was possible because of continuing declines in the number of people hospitalized for COVID-19 and the availability of intensive care unit beds to treat those who are most seriously ill. Des Moines: Hold the pork chop on a stick and get a butter cow rain check. Thie Iowa State Fair was canceled because of coronavirus concerns, marking the first time since World War II that the annual gathering won’t be held in Des Moines. Without comment, the state fair board voted 11-2 to cancel the fair, which typically caps an Iowa summer with an 11-day run in mid-August. The fair is the biggest attraction in Iowa, typically drawing more than 1 million visitors who check out the butter cow, buy pork chops or countless other food typically skewered with a stick and stroll through 445 acres of barns, carnival attractions and even a campground. Officials in Minnesota, Wisconsin and Indiana also have canceled their fairs, though state fairs are going ahead in some states, including Nebraska, South Dakota and Kansas. Wichita: A Catholic church in Wichita has temporarily closed after a priest tested positive for COVID-19. Matt Davied of the Church of the Magdalen said in a Facebook post on the church’s account that he underwent testing after waking up feeling ill on Wednesday. He said he is now in isolation. Because the priests live together in the rectory, a second priest is in quarantine. All Masses at the church have been suspended and live streams will be temporarily discontinued, The Wichita Eagle reported. Frankfort: Education and health officials plan to meet Friday to discuss how to safely reopen schools during the coronavirus pandemic. The Kentucky Department for Public Health is working on protocols and will meet with the leaders at the Kentucky Department of Education to “hone the guidance,” Interim Education Commissioner Kevin C. Brown said in a statement. A timeline for the release of the guidance will be established at the meeting, officials said. The Department for Public Health has implemented Healthy at Work guidance and officials said schools should follow similar guidelines that include wearing face masks and social distancing. Brown said he thinks districts can begin looking at an August start date for classes, but should be prepared to switch to nontraditional instruction if circumstances call for it. Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University scientists will be testing sewage for genetic traces of the novel coronavirus in Baton Rouge. The technique is being used in many places. Although most sewage systems use gravity to bring sewage to a central plant, flat cities like New Orleans and Baton Rouge must use pumping stations. Because Baton Rouge has more than 500 pumping stations, “we can get precise with our sampling,” environmental engineering professor John Pardue said in a news release Tuesday from LSU. Tulane University said a $1 million donation from Colorado cookbook author Elana Amsterdam and her husband, Vail Resorts CEO Rob Katz, will let it more than triple its ability to test for COVID-19. Equipment bought with the money will enable 1,000 tests a day, up from 300, a news release said Monday. Tulane said its lab ran about 3,000 tests from April 1 until mid-May. Those included almost 1,400 from Orleans Parish Prison, 300 from a clinic set up in the Morial Convention Center and 600 from patients of state mental health facilities. Amsterdam and Katz are parents of a student at Tulane, university spokesman Keith Brannon said. Augusta: State Senate President Troy Jackson said “we’re getting close” to the point where state lawmakers can reconvene, three months after they adjourned and gave Democratic Gov. Janet Mills broad emergency powers to address the coronavirus pandemic. Although Mills has come under criticism, state lawmakers have remained on the sidelines and tensions flared last week when the labor commissioner skipped an oversight hearing. But that might be changing. “I certainly feel like we are getting close to the point where we may reconvene and, at that time, her emergency powers either won’t be the same, or they won’t be there at all,” Jackson told the Portland Press Herald. Neither Jackson nor House Speaker Sara Gideon, both Democrats, would provide a specific timetable because details have yet to be worked out about how best to safely reconvene amid an ongoing public crisis. Mills could call the Legislature back into special session at any time. She told lawmakers in March that they should reconvene “when it is safe to do so.” On Thursday, members of the much-larger state House of Representatives reconvened at an indoor arena on the University of New Hampshire campus to ensure social distancing guidelines. Baltimore: Federal agents have seized thousands of COVID-19 treatment capsules and dozens of testing kits, saying the items were all imported from China and are fake. A Baltimore-based team of agents from Homeland Security Investigations found the COVID-19 treatment capsules at the Port of Baltimore, hidden in boxes under packets of Chinese tea, WJZ reported. John Eisert, HSI Baltimore special agent in charge, said his team is concerned about what’s inside the capsules, which were touted as being able to relieve coronoavirus patients of their symptoms. Eisert said prior seizures of pharmaceuticals have revealed ingredients such as sheet rock, pesticides and lead. HSI launched a nationwide operation, Operation Stolen Promise, to seize COVID contraband. Agents also are trying to take down websites where these products are available to be purchased and shipped to the U.S. Boston: Even as ridership remains low, the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority is preparing to ramp up service across all of modes of transit, including subways, buses, ferries and commuter rail. Beginning June 21, regular weekday subway service will operate on the Blue Line and increased weekday service will operate on the Red, Orange, Green, and Mattapan lines. Service will also be increased for nearly 60 high-demand bus routes in the metropolitan Boston area. On June 22, commuter rail service will be increased and ferry service will resume on weekdays. The changes come as the state begins to reopen after months of a stay-at-home advisory meant to help curb the spread of the new coronavirus that led to plummeting ridership on the public transit system. MBTA officials said that although passenger volume continues to be just a fraction of prepandemic levels, they will continue to closely monitor ridership and undesirable crowding and make adjustments as needed. Riders are required to wear masks and try to maintain social distance when possible. Port Huron:An annual sailboat race along Lake Huron will be held next month, despite cancellations of other events because of the coronavirus pandemic. The Bayview Port Huron race is planned for July 11, the Times Herald reported. This year’s race will have one route instead of two. Participation is down about 40% so far, which Bayview Mackinac race chairman Chris Clark credited to circumstances related to the pandemic. “The mantra this year is ‘Patience and Flexibility,’ ” Clark wrote in an email. “We are working hard with all those involved in hosting the race to make sure everyone has a safe fun race!.” The Chicago Yacht Club posted a statement last week announcing the cancellation of the 2020 Chicago to Mackinac Island sailboat race. Race Chairman Martin Sandoval said the Chicago race’s committee had taken a “patient and pragmatic” approach to following limitations and guidelines. The race was scheduled for July 17. Clark noted that the Chicago race does not affect the Bayview race. “The CYC race to Mackinac is a great race and it is sad to see any Great Lakes race needing to be canceled. Chicago is facing their own unique issues that are not the same as ours.” Other summer events in Port Huron, including the Blue Water Fest and the 100th annual International Day Parade, have been canceled. St. Paul:Another 13 Minnesotans died from COVID-19 and 453 more people have tested positive for the disease, according to Thursday’s report from the Minnesota Department of Health. Stearns County reported seven more cases Thursday, Sherburne County reported one and Benton County had no new cases, according to the report. Stearns County now has reported 2,088 cases and 17 deaths, Sherburne County has reported 261 cases and two deaths and Benton County has reported 190 cases and three deaths. Statewide, the number of people who tested positive for the novel coronavirus reached 29,316 on Thursday and 1,249 people have died, according to the report. Of those cases, 24,870 patients no longer need isolation. As of Thursday, 411 people remain hospitalized with the virus, and 196 of them remain in intensive care. In total, 3,522 cases have required hospitalization. Vicksburg: Efforts to reduce the spread of the new coronavirus have further delayed the return of cruises along the Mississippi River. American Cruise Lines announced this week that it would resume operations on the river July 11, The Vicksburg Post reported. It was previously expected to resume in late June. Vicksburg Convention and Visitors Bureau Executive Director Laura Beth Strickland told the newspaper that the American Harmony cruise liner was now set to arrive in Vicksburg on July 13. The American Queen Steamboat Company also delayed its return to the river because of the virus. Its cruise is now expected to return to Vicksburg on July 17. Before the pandemic, the Vicksburg Convention and Visitors Bureau had projected a record year for riverboat traffic. St. Louis: With St. Louis County scheduled to completely reopen Monday, a gym business and the county have agreed to drop a lawsuit filed after two gyms a opened despite a county stay-at-home order. The county will permit gyms, theaters, fitness centers and pools to reopen Monday. Attorneys for the county and the House of Pain agreed to drop the case, according to a court filing on Wednesday, The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported. House of Pain gyms in Maryland Heights and Chesterfield reopened in defiance of the county restrictions, sparking county and federal lawsuits. House of Pain attorney W. Christopher McDonough argued the county regulations conflicted with state and federal laws. Helena: New applications for unemployment benefits in Montana have declined, but the number of new applications submitted last week was more than twice as high as it was during in the same week last year, officials said Thursday. The number of new applications for job assistance submitted in Montana last week fell to 2,892, according to the U.S. Employment and Training Administration. That’s a decrease of 5% from the number of applications submitted the previous week, but an increase of 256.2% compared to the same week last year. As of May 30, 44,929 people in Montana were receiving unemployment benefits. That represents 9.9% of all eligible employees in the state. The state has processed 111,644 claims for unemployment since March 14, representing 24.5% of Montana’s workforce that is eligible for the unemployment insurance program. Lincoln: The state potentially faces nearly $3.7 billion in agricultural losses from the coronavirus pandemic if economic conditions do not improve, the Nebraska Farm Bureau said. Its estimate projects revenue losses for this year’s commodities, including corn, soybeans, wheat, beef cattle and pork production, as well as dairy and ethanol products, the Lincoln Journal Star reported. It does not account for any financial assistance farmers and ranchers receive from COVID-19 relief programs. Jay Rempe, the Nebraska Farm Bureau’s senior economist, said the analysis “clearly demonstrates the magnitude of the financial challenges currently facing farm and ranch families,” adding that impact could be felt across the broader rural economy. The analysis pegs potential estimated losses in the beef cattle sector at nearly $1 billion in 2020. Potential corn and soybean losses were estimated at $1.17 billion. Losses in the ethanol sector could reach $1.3 billion, assuming that ethanol plants are unable to operate at more than 75% of capacity for the remainder of the year. “Farmers and ranchers are really struggling,” Nebraska Farm Bureau President Steve Nelson said. Carson City: Less than a week after Nevada reopened doors to its casinos, Gov. Steve Sisolak announced students could return for summer school coursework. Sisolak signed a directive Tuesday to allow school districts, charter schools and private schools operating in Nevada to reopen immediately. “This directive will allow schools to return to a sense of normalcy while keeping the health and safety of students and staff at the forefront,” Sisolak said in a statement. The directive gives schools broad decision-making power over whether to hold in-person classes, remote learning or a combination as they conduct summer school courses. It arrives almost two months after Sisolak ordered Nevada schools closed March 15 to curb the spread of new coronavirus and less than two weeks after Nevada begun transitioning to Phase 2 of his “Roadmap to Recovery” plan. The directive also requires schools to develop reopening plans in accordance with a Department of Education-devised framework at least 20 days before the start of the 2020-2021 school year. The framework outlines key considerations for schools to consider, including hygiene, social distancing, face coverings and communicating with students and parents. Nevada Superintendent of Public Instruction Jhone Ebert said the directive offered school districts “flexibility” to determine reopening protocols based on local circumstances. Concord: A boat that cruises around Lake Winnipesaukee will be back in business soon, with fewer outings and passengers. The M/S Mount Washington will start offering lunch cruises on June 20 and dinner cruises on June 27. One lunch cruise will be offered every day from Weirs Beach, including a first-time Father’s Day cruise on June 21. In the past, the holiday conflicted with Laconia Bike Week, which has been postponed. Dinner cruises will be offered on Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays, and Saturdays. This will allow time to do additional cleaning between cruises. The number of passengers on board has been reduced by more than 50%. Buffet service will be replaced by table service on all cruises. Asbury Park: This Jersey shore city often associated with Bruce Springsteen is defying Gov. Phil Murphy’s executive order and will allow limited indoor dining at its restaurants. The City Council on Wednesday approved a resolution permitting its restaurants to host diners inside at 25% of the building’s capacity or 50 people, whichever is less, beginning June 15. The governor on Tuesday set similar restrictions for indoor gatherings when he announced only outdoor dining for bars and restaurants could resume on June 15. The Democrat has yet to say when they can reopen for indoor seating. According to the Asbury Park Press, Deputy Mayor Amy Quinn said the city took the action because restrictions implemented to control the coronavirus pandemic were taking a toll on the city’s restaurants. A popular eatery announced last week it would close permanently. Allowing diners inside still carries risks. “While the city of Asbury Park is not going to levy any fines against you, the state of New Jersey could,” Quinn said. Murphy’s office has not commented. Las Cruces: The Las Cruces Economic Recovery Board convened for the first time this week to address local economic needs as businesses reopen. The board selected leadership and discussed what health steps board members had seen taken in their respective industries. They discussed building a campaign to instill public confidence it will be safe to patronize businesses under a “new normal.” The city formed the ad hoc board on local economic recovery last month after some city council members were concerned the city and Doña Ana County weren’t well-represented on the state’s Economic Recovery Council. The state’s Economic Recovery Council worked with state health officials to formulate industry-specific COVID-safe practices business owners and employees should follow to mitigate spread of the virus as New Mexico’s economy continues to reopen. The board, which will meet weekly, said it will work in alignment with the state’s Economic Recovery Council and develop Las Cruces-specific recommendations and practices. New York City: Some businesses have jumped ahead on what’s supposed to be a slow and methodical emergence from the coronavirus lockdown. Stores in parts of New York City have started to allow customers inside to shop, even though the phased reopening that began Monday only allows retailers to sell merchandise via curbside pickup for now. At least a dozen customers perused racks of women’s clothing inside Mini-Max in Brooklyn’s Sunset Park neighborhood on Wednesday. Shoppers mostly self-policed for social distancing, which wasn’t difficult given the store’s size, but the only restriction applied by owner Albert Abeal was that customers must wear masks. “We just opened. Everybody’s hungry for merchandise,” said Abeal, who has owned the store for about 20 years. He said business this week had essentially returned to normal, although he didn’t expect that to last. “They didn’t buy clothes for so long. It’s going to slow down in a week.” Raleigh: The administration of Gov. Roy Cooper has ordered the closure of a small stock-car track that has allowed large crowds to gather repeatedly for weekend races, declaring it an “imminent hazard” for the spread of COVID-19. The order signed by Cooper’s health secretary said Ace Speedway in Alamance County, 65 miles northwest of Raleigh, is violating the governor’s executive order limiting outside mass assemblies to 25 people. Media outlets have reported crowds at the speedway exceeding 2,000 people, including a gathering on June 6 even after the Democratic governor’s office wrote a letter stating the speedway’s actions were in “open defiance” of the health restrictions. Media reports indicated many attendees at three weekend races since late May sat and stood near each other, and few wore masks. The action came after Alamance County Sheriff Terry Johnson said Monday he wouldn’t issue a misdemeanor citation to the speedway. He questioned the legality of Cooper’s restrictions and said local tracks elsewhere weren’t being punished for opening. Cooper had said he would act if Alamance County officials wouldn’t. “North Carolinians are making huge sacrifices to protect their families and neighbors. This virus is highly contagious and very dangerous,” Health and Human Services Secretary Mandy Cohen said in a news release. “Bad actors who flagrantly violate public health orders put all of our families and loved ones at risk.” The next regularly scheduled race at the quarter-mile track is June 19. Bismarck: Mass testing for the new coronavirus returned to Fargo on Thursday, about a month after targeted screenings were started to help lower the number of cases in North Dakota’s most populous metropolitan area. The surveillance testing, meant to identify people who might have COVID-19 but aren’t showing symptoms, is being held at the Fargodome for the next two days. State officials said they are well-stocked with testing kits and are looking to expand mass testing to Grand Forks, Bismarck and Minot. Meanwhile, members of a task force tackling the state’s hot spot are focusing on contact tracing of positive tests from concentrating on vulnerable populations, Fargo Mayor Tim Mahoney said. Cass County is likely to top 2,000 COVID-19 cases in the next day. The mass testing, Mahoney said, should help the metropolitan area go further in reducing restrictions on businesses. Cleveland: The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame is reopening, but fans will need to practice social distancing by staying at least “two Stratocasters apart” and bring their credit cards, officials said Thursday. Rock’s shrine will reopen on June 15 after closing on March 14 because of the coronavirus pandemic. Visitors must practice social distancing of 6 feet, or at least the distance of two Stratocaster guitars. Temperatures will be checked at the door and fans must wear masks. There will be continuous cleaning inside and hand sanitizers. There also will be advance online ticketing, limited capacity with timed ticketing and no cash will be accepted. Officials said nearly 600,000 people visit the museum annually. Live music is scheduled to resume on the plaza in July. The Hall will offer free admission to health care workers and their families on June 14. Oklahoma City: Revenue collections in Oklahoma continue to fall below projections as the state starts to reopen businesses that were stalled because of the coronavirus pandemic. The state Office of Management and Enterprise Services reported revenue collections in May of $490.1 million – $65.5 million, or 11.8%, below estimates and $83.8 million, or 14.6%, below May 2019 collections. “May’s revenue collections shortfall was expected, as continual losses suffered by the oil and gas industry negatively impact the state,” OMES Director Steve Harpe said in a statement Tuesday. Businesses began reopening in late April under a plan by Gov. Kevin Stitt. Gross production taxes, which include taxes on natural gas and oil, were $28.2 million for the month, $55.7 million, or 66.4%, below the estimate. Sales tax collections of $164.1 million were $29.1 million, or 15%, below estimates. Total revenue collections during the first 11 months of fiscal year that ends June 30 were $552.3 million, or 8.8%, below the estimate, according to OMES. Portland: State public health officials said a coronavirus outbreak at a North Bend prison has been resolved. The minimum-security prison at one point had 25 infected inmates and three infected employees, The Oregonian/OregonLive reported. It is one of four state prisons with confirmed cases of the virus. A spokesperson for the Oregon Health Authority said in an email that an outbreak is considered over 28 days after the date of the last onset of symptoms for people with the virus. At the Oregon State Penitentiary, the state’s maximum-security prison in Salem, cases have slowed, said Christopher DiGiulio, the chief of medicine for the Oregon Department of Corrections. The prison has reported one new case of coronavirus in the past several days, he said. Previously, the state was reporting as many as 20 new cases a day there, he said. As of Tuesday, the total number of confirmed cases among Oregon inmates stood at 167. Another 47 employees also have tested positive. The outbreak at the Oregon State Penitentiary remains the largest in the state with a total of 168 cases among inmates and workers combined. Among inmates, 93 are considered recovered, DiGiulio said. Philadelphia: The city’s health commissioner said there is concern that protests following the death of George Floyd in Minnesota will lead to a spike in virus infections in the city, but so far, “there’s no evidence of transmission yet.” Dr. Thomas Farley said at an online news conference Thursday that many of the protesters in Philadelphia were wearing masks and that “in many cases they were keeping a distance from other people.” On Saturday, thousands jammed the city’s grand Benjamin Franklin Parkway to demonstrate against police treatment of black people and racial injustice. “It’s still early. We’re going to have to watch this for at least another week, but so far, so good,” Farley said. Officials have urged demonstrators to get tested. Portsmouth: A park is being turned into a temporary drive-in theater by a local nonprofit known for bringing powerful documentaries to the public. NewportFILM hasn’t been able to hold its full range of programs recently because of the coronavirus pandemic, but on June 25, it will screen the film “Public Trust” at Glen Park, The Newport Daily News reported. The 96-minute film follows journalist Hal Herring as he explores protecting the nation’s public lands, said Becca Bertrand, executive director of the nonprofit. The Portsmouth Town Council earlier this week gave approval for the project. The event will be limited to 100 cars, which will be spaced 6 feet apart in rows separated by 20 feet. Preregistration will be required. Columbia: State epidemiologist Dr. Linda Bell, the top South Carolina health official overseeing efforts to fight the coronavirus outbreak, said she’s worried a lack of social distancing and adherence to other preventative measures are hampering efforts to fight the pandemic as infection numbers continue to rise. “Today I am more concerned about COVID-19 in South Carolina than I have ever been before,” Bell said during a news conference. “We are all eager to return to our normal lives … but it will take us that much longer to get there if we don’t stop the virus today.” In the past two weeks, Bell said that South Carolina had posted its highest new daily case counts since the beginning of the pandemic. On Wednesday, Bell noted more than 500 new positive tests had been posted, for a total of more than 15,700 in the state. Thus far, she said, 575 people in the state have died. Among her concerns, Bell noted a widespread lack of mask-wearing and social distancing, as some South Carolinians relax their attitudes toward restrictions surrounding the outbreak. She also cited a lack of self-isolation in new hot spot areas like Greenville, where some infected people have spread the virus to other members of their households. Nearly a third of cases in that area, Bell said, were among Greenville’s Latino population, a circumstance that had prompted state health officials to step up Spanish-language materials about the virus and prevention efforts. Sioux Falls:Despite canceled events in surrounding states, the Sioux Empire Fair and the South Dakota State Fair are planned to run as scheduled, officials said. As for the Sturgis Rally, the state’s most popular event, officials and business owners appear at odds about whether it will happen. The Iowa and Minnesota state fairs announced that they would be canceled for the first time in decades. The Minnesota State Fair was canceled May 22. The Iowa State Fair was canceled Wednesday. For the South Dakota fairs, they just might look a little different, said Courtney Drenth, director of marketing and public relations for the Sioux Empire Fair. “We want to give people something to look forward to with the fair,” Drenth said. “As a state, a lot of people are looking forward to end of summer events, like the Sturgis Rally and fairs. This is giving people something to celebrate.” The Sioux Empire Fair at the W.H. Lyons Fairgrounds is the second-largest event in the state with about 300,000 people attending over the nine-day event. The Sturgis Rally is far and away the largest, with 490,000 in attendance in 2019, according to the Sturgis Rally website. The Sioux Empire Fair is planned from July 31 to Aug. 8. As of now, all concerts – including headlining country band Old Dominion – are planned as scheduled, with seating and standing area planned as normal. The fair will also have several vendors and a carnival. The fair usually holds about 50 food vendors and up to 40 carnival rides. Although officials haven’t completed what changes there will be this year, the South Dakota State Fair will likely “be scaled to ensure Centers for Disease Control (CDC) guidelines are being implemented,” according to an announcement from the state Department of Agriculture. The fair is planned for Sept. 3 through Sept. 7 Memphis:The Stax Museum of American Soul Music said it plans to reopen to the public after closing for three months because of the coronavirus pandemic. The museum said it will start welcoming visitors on June 18. It closed March 18 as officials in Memphis issued coronavirus-related safety orders that shuttered tourist destinations like Stax and Graceland. Located in Memphis’ Soulsville neighborhood, Stax produced records by some of the top soul artists of the 1960s and 1970s, including Otis Redding, Isaac Hayes, Sam & Dave, Carla and Rufus Thomas, The Staple Singers, Booker T. and the MG’s, and others. The museum features self-guided tours of exhibits about the recording studio’s history and memorabilia connected to Stax artists, such as Hayes’ flashy Cadillac car. The reopening includes a new exhibit featuring Stax album cover photographs. Stax said admission and merchandise transactions will now be cashless. Austin:The tide of coronavirus-induced layoffs in Texas appears to be slowly receding, with weekly claims for first-time unemployment benefits in the state down for the seventh week in a row and slipping below 100,000 for the first time since mid-March. But the number of newly out-of-work Texans who have been filing for benefits remains huge by prepandemic standards. The roughly 90,000 who did so last week is about seven times more than the weekly average in February, before the virus shuttered large swaths of the state and national economies, according to U.S. Labor Department data. In addition, some economists said the new claims over the past few weeks likely signal that the financial hit from the virus has been spreading because fresh job losses probably aren’t the result of layoffs at restaurants, retail stores and other consumer-facing businesses that felt the impact immediately and took action during the early days of the pandemic. “Who are the almost 90,000 people who lost their jobs last week as we continue to open up the Texas economy?” said Jason Schenker, president of Prestige Economics in Austin. Although the data doesn’t make that clear, Schenker said those jobs “may take a while to get back” because they appear to be tied more to the broad economic downturn triggered by the virus than to the stay-at-home orders and mandatory business closures that now are being lifted. But Schenker and others called the decline in first-time claims for unemployment benefits a positive development, at least in terms of indicating that the deluge of layoffs has been tapering and fewer people overall are losing their jobs. Salt Lake City: Utah’s rate of positive COVID-19 tests has skyrocketed in recent weeks, leading at least one prominent doctor to suggest the state might need to take a step back after a month of reopenings. That happened this week in the northern Utah city of Logan, where city officials closed the library and the recreation center again for the foreseeable future. Dr. Samuel Brown, a critical care researcher at Intermountain Healthcare, said he’s concerned that Utah might have to shut down again if people don’t seriously practice mask-wearing and social distancing in the rush to reopen businesses and get the economy jump-started. “I understand why people are eager to be on the move again – I really do,” Brown said “It’s also true that if we’re not really careful, people will die.” Utah is among a large number of states in the U.S. with rising cases, according to an Associated Press analysis. State epidemiologist Dr. Angela Dunn last week urged Utah residents to continue social distancing and wearing masks about a month after much of the state has been allowed to reopen. Montpelier: The state is on the verge of allowing mail-in voting for this fall’s presidential election, a step seen as preparatory in case a resurgence of the coronavirus pandemic makes in-person balloting too dangerous. The House is scheduled to give final approval to the proposal Friday after it passed the Senate. It would then be sent to Gov. Phil Scott, a Republican who has said he supports preparations to vote by mail but wanted to wait to see if it would be necessary. Voters would receive ballots in the mail and could mail them back, take them to their local clerk or take them to their polling place on Election Day. Bristol: The Birthplace of Country Music Museum reopened Thursday and offered free passes to health care workers. The offer is a thank you for health care workers’ “bravery and compassion in the wake of COVID-19,” according to a news release from the museum. The passes are for a health care worker and a guest. The offer will run through the end of August. The museum near the Virginia-Tennessee line said it plans to resume normal hours of operation. The museum intends to cap the number of people in the building at any time at 100. That includes visitors, staff and volunteers. All three groups will be required to wear face masks while inside the facility. Visitors who don’t bring their own will be provided one at the front desk. Seattle: Chris Reykdal, the state’s superintendent of public instruction, said he expects school districts to reopen buildings and return to in-person learning this fall as long as public health guidelines amid the coronavirus pandemic allow it. Reykdal and a work group of more than 120 educators, parents, students and community organizations released a 47-page document with new guidance that shows what face-to-face instruction could look like. How and whether schools reopen depends, at least in part, on what phase their county is in as part of Gov. Jay Inslee’s reopening plan, The Seattle Times reported. But education officials said schools should plan to resume class in-person. The guidance leaves most decisions up to school districts. Districts that can’t open right away, or bring all students back because of public health concerns, are encouraged to use a combination of distance learning and staggered scheduling. The education department is asking districts to make contingency plans that would allow them to move quickly from in-person instruction to remote learning should cases of the virus surge. Districts should add days to their school calendar in case of emergency short-term building closures, officials said as an example. Districts should also make plans to conduct learning remotely if schools are forced to close again for an extended period, officials wrote. Clifftop: This summer’s Appalachian String Band Music Festival has been canceled in response to the coronavirus pandemic, the West Virginia Department of Arts, Culture and History said. The annual five-day camping event included music contests, dancing, arts and crafts and games. It had been set for July 29 to Aug. 2 at Camp Washington-Carver in Clifftop in Fayette County. The decision to cancel was made to lessen the effect of the new coronavirus, the agency said in a news release. The festival usually draws thousands of string band musicians and fans for concerts, dancing, workshops and contests. It will be rescheduled for next year, the department said. Milwaukee:With the new coronavirus continuing to spread, Milwaukee County will now require all employees and members of the public who use county facilities to wear a face covering. Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley issued a ""universal face mask policy"" on Tuesday. The policy requires that employees, contractors, vendors, volunteers, service users and members of the public wear face masks when entering county facilities and grounds that have a ""controlled entry point."" Masks are recommended but not required at the airport, on buses and in outdoor park spaces including the beer gardens, according to a statement from his office. Face coverings help to mitigate the transmission of virus, which spreads through respiratory droplets. Acceptable face masks can be made of cloth or paper and can be a scarf or bandanna, he said. The county will provide masks for many of the people required to wear one, Crowley said. Children between the ages of 3 and 12 should only wear masks if parents or guardians are monitoring them to make sure they’re worn safely, he said. Cheyenne: Gov. Mark Gordon announced plans to allow schools to reopen and people to gather in larger numbers indoors despite a surge in coronavirus cases in one county. Meanwhile, University of Wyoming trustees approved plans to resume in-person classes this fall if the school gets $25 million in state funding to offset the cost of guarding against the virus. “Wyoming has made outstanding progress to date,” Gordon said in a statement. “Folks need to remember that it is important to remain vigilant, but because we have been so successful, I am confident we can continue lifting the very few remaining public health restrictions.” Under new public health orders to take effect Monday, up to 250 people will be allowed to gather indoors if they practice social distancing – keeping at least 6 feet apart – and sanitation measures. Up to 50 people will be permitted to gather indoors without such measures. Class-size restrictions will be lifted for childcare facilities. Personal care services will no longer have to be appointment-only."

But first, while many in the state are focused on reopening the economy, California’s physicians, nurses and medical staff continue working in extraordinary times. Desert Sun reporter Nicole Hayden and photojournalist Vickie Connor went inside the coronavirus unit at Eisenhower Health in Rancho Mirage. They report that a day in the life of the COVID-19 unit “not only presents daily challenges in addressing rapidly changing patient care, but also in coping with the heaviness of the frontlines versus how the rest of the world is experiencing the pandemic.” Stay safe and informed with news and resources from across the USA TODAY Network and beyond: Sign up for In California today (it's free!). Here in Riverside County, which has been approved for accelerated reopening, six casinos in or near the Coachella Valley opened their doors today to guests who were eager to gamble on slot machines and play card games, despite a request from Gov. Gavin Newsom to stay closed. Newsom sent a letter to California tribes on May 15 urging them not to reopen their gaming facilities. But tribes are sovereign nations and don’t have to follow local or state stay-at-home orders. Several popular casinos in the San Diego area opened earlier this week. Casinos are considered higher-risk workplaces because of the volume of people they attract and fall under Stage 3 of the governor’s reopening plan. Desert Sun reporters Risa Johnson and Andrew John visited some of the casinos that opened today. They report that when the doors to Spotlight 29 Casino near Coachella opened at 10 a.m., after a closure that has lasted more than two months, someone from the crowd yelled, “Freedom!” Leaders in Tulare County, meanwhile, have opted to progress to Phase 3 of the state’s reopening plan against the advice of health officials — a decision that has sparked the ire of Newsom and leaders in the Tulare County cities of Tulare, Visalia, Porterville and Farmersville, reports Joshua Yeager for the Visalia Times-Delta. “I’m deeply sensitive and have deep admiration and respect for the elected officials of Tulare County,” Newsom said Friday during a press conference. “I want them to know I understand their deep desire that I share (to) reopen every aspect of the economy and go back to normalcy that we had just 100 days ago.” Still, he said, it “breaks my heart” that Tulare County is reopening and that as a result, loved ones “will lose their lives” who otherwise wouldn’t. Earlier in the week, Newsom listed Tulare and Kings counties, both in the agricultural Central Valley, as two of five counties that should remain closed as a result of the pandemic. He pointed to severe outbreaks at nursing homes and meatpacking facilities as obstacles preventing the bi-county region from restarting much of its economy. Most public Memorial Day gatherings have been canceled this year. But there are other ways to pay tribute to the nation's fallen soldiers, according to Frank Bell, director of the Palm Springs Air Museum. ""There's the opportunity to fly flags, show your patriotism through social media or in other ways,"" Bell said. Here are other ways to spend the Memorial Day weekend, while following health recommendations. If you live in Central California: Grab a Tulare County Fair snack. The Fair Food Drive-Thru, presented by 9 Iron Bar & Grill, is open this weekend, Friday through Sunday. Local favorites include barbecue turkey legs, caramel and candy apples, corn dogs and cotton candy. If you live in Southern California: Camp in Joshua Tree National Park. The popular desert park reopened this week. Family camping is permitted but group camping sites remain closed. Health officials say camping should be kept within the family. But if two households decide to camp together, they should practice social distancing measures and not share food, utensils or plates. Face coverings don’t necessarily need to be worn, but should be handy. If you live in Northern California: Go kayaking in Whiskeytown National Recreation Area. Many of the popular attractions in the 42,000-acre park near Redding have been closed during the pandemic. Kayak rentals are now available at Brandy Creek Beach and boat rentals are available at the Oak Bottom Marina.

Here’s some of the standout work our team has produced this week: Health reporter Nicole Hayden and environment reporter Mark Olalde reported that most California counties are falling short on testing and contact tracing — two key tools for limiting coronavirus spread as some activity and business close restrictions are lifted. Business reporter Melissa Daniels reported that taco trucks have become an “unexpected oasis” for hungry essential workers on the road during the coronavirus pandemic. The food trucks are participating in a Caltrans program that helps truckers and other travelers stay fed when many other dining options are shuttered.

Brazil is the second hardest-hit country worldwide, with more than 374,000 confirmed cases and more than 23,400 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins University data dashboard. The U.S. is the worst hit in the world, with deaths approaching 100,000, the dashboard says.

Check out the 5 things podcast below and subscribe for free on Apple Podcasts: The New York Stock Exchange trading floor will begin a phased reopening Tuesday, after more than 2 months of all-electronic trading. NYSE President Stacey Cunningham said in The Wall Street Journal that floor brokers will return at smaller numbers initially. They will also take safety precautions, including wearing protective masks when working and following social-distancing requirements. The rest of the building will remain largely empty and most employees will continue to work remotely. None of the traders or employees will be required to come in, but she said expects “it will be hard to keep them away.”  Puerto Rico will reopen beaches, restaurants, churches, hair salons and retail stores Tuesday under strict new rules. Gov. Wanda Vázquez said a 7 p.m-to-5 a.m. curfew will remain in place until June 15. All people will be required to wear a mask when outside or inside a business, regardless of what they are doing. Many Puerto Ricans, including business owners, cheered the highly anticipated announcement. Health experts, however, warned that the government has not tested enough people or conducted enough contact tracing and is not prepared for a possible spike in new infections.  More than 1,300 state or federal lawsuits have been filed over COVID-19 as governors balance protecting public health against individual liberties. In Minnesota, churches joined non-essential businesses in suing to block what they described as ""a draconian shutdown that picks winners and losers, with devastating effects."" U.S. District Judge Wilhelmina Wright scheduled a hearing in the case for Tuesday. The lawsuits come as President Donald Trump has become increasingly vocal in criticism of state restrictions, encouraged protests at state capitols and urged churches to reopen despite restrictions.  It's safe to say that spending habits have changed drastically during the coronavirus pandemic, with 45% of Americans saying the pandemic has cost them money.While many are saving money on childcare and not dining out, a new TD Ameritrade survey shows, they are still spending more on groceries and cleaning products.To break it down: Americans have saved more in quarantine by not going to restaurants (78%), going on vacation (75%) or buying clothes (73%). But in exchange, they have doled out more on groceries (57%), cleaning products (53%), takeout food (33%) and streaming services (32%). On the bright side: 82% of Americans said they realized they don’t have to spend money to have a good time.  Contributing: Associated Press"
79,79,"As coronavirus rages, medical residents are stressed to breaking pointAshely Alker ","May 26, 2020",https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/hiddencommonground/2020/05/22/coronavirus-places-already-stressed-medical-residents-high-risk-column/5235163002/,"As a newly minted attending physician, I could not have imagined my first months of independent practice would coincide with one of the most devastating medical disasters in U.S. history. However unfortunate the timing, I am a fully trained physician, with the capacity to determine my involvement in the pandemic. I choose to work in the emergency department and care for COVID-19 patients. But I find myself with an ever increasing concern for medical trainees, who are unable to choose their roles during this time. Somewhere between employee and student lies the land of medical residency. To become a board-certified “attending” physician in the United States, you must complete a residency. These years of training are considered the most challenging of a physician’s medical career. The difficulty stems from a combination of isolation, sleep deprivation and in some cases institutionalized abuse. A systemic review published by the Journal of the American Medical Association showed the prevalence of depression or depressive symptoms among resident physicians ranged from 20.9% to 43.2%, a percentage that increases with each year of residency. In 2018, two New York City physician residents tragically took their own lives within several days of each other. These same residency programs are now under the increased pressure of serving at the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic. I have spoken to residents during the pandemic who have expressed concern for their health and safety, including inadequate personal protective equipment, but many will not speak out for fear of repercussions by their institutions. Most of the residents I have spoken with asked that their quotes remain anonymous; some refused to be quoted at all, for fear their words may somehow be traced back to them. But one resident was ready to speak out. Share your coronavirus story: Contact USA TODAY Opinion's hotline. We may publish your comments. “We are in a unique situation,” said Dr. Megan Tresenriter, an emergency medicine resident in San Diego. “Unlike other employees, if we feel unsafe or coerced, we cannot quit. We will not be eligible to become autonomous physicians if we do not complete our residency requirements, leaving most of us feeling we have no choice or voice.” Other residents interviewed expressed their fear and a feeling of being viewed as “disposable” by health care systems. During residency, you lack many basic employee rights. For instance, you cannot negotiate your salary, and your job location is determined by The Match system, another nonnegotiable process that places doctors at their residency home for three to six years. If a physician terminates their residency, the path to becoming a board-certified doctor meets an unceremonious end. Medical residents are arguably the most financially undervalued employees of the health care system. The average U.S. medical student debt is $190,000, and tens of thousands of dollars of interest will accumulate on these student loans during residency. Residents spend the most hours in the hospital, with the greatest amount of patient contact, being paid similar hourly wages to big-box store cashiers. In contrast, stores like Walmart are compensating their employees with hazard pay during the pandemic. As an alternative to hazard pay, an internal medicine residency program in Denver revoked its residents’ annual stipend increase, stating, “This was a very difficult decision but one that is in alignment with the entire hospital system.” At Denver Health, a hospital staffed by these same residents, executives were given six-figure bonuses in April. Contrary to their financial compensation, residents are the foundation and backbone of major hospital systems throughout the United States. And during the COVID-19 pandemic, we need strong policy to protect these physicians in training. In 2003, the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education instated work hour restrictions for resident physicians of 80 hours per week. These restrictions were created after the death of 18-year-old Libby Zion, as the result of a medical error made by a resident working a 36-hour shift. The girl's father wrote a New York Times op-ed stating, ""You don't need kindergarten to know that a resident working a 36-hour shift is in no condition to make any kind of judgment call — forget about life and death.""  Resident work hour restrictions must be strictly enforced during the COVID-19 pandemic. Other considerations that should be discussed include using residents to cover hospital services outside of their medical specialty and creating the opportunity for residents to opt out of aerosolizing procedures, which throw the virus into the air. Institutions should have further stringent precautions for residents who are immunocompromised or pregnant. Residents must be given adequate daily personal protective equipment. They should not be required to use reduced protections. They must be given sterile N95 masks, gowns, face shields or powered air-purifying respirators for aerosolizing procedures. If hospitals do not have the correct protective equipment for residents, they should not allow trainees to work with COVID-19 patients. In most states, workers’ compensation requires front-line health care workers suffering from COVID-19 to provide proof the virus was contracted at work, which is nearly impossible. Residents need comprehensive workers’ compensation coverage for any COVID-19 related illnesses, including mental health, incurred during the pandemic. Finally, residents need anonymous and nonretaliatory means of submitting whistleblower information specific to the pandemic, to be investigated immediately by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education. Taking steps to care for residents during the pandemic will result in superior patient care and protect the moral integrity of our health care system. We have lost resident physicians to COVID-19. There will surely be further loss of resident life during this pandemic, and these young doctors deserve every protection we can afford them in this battle. A current resident and previous Air Force captain, who served in Afghanistan, drew similarities between his residency and his time in the military. When describing ideal hospital leadership during the pandemic, he told me of how his favorite superior officers led from the front, which included recognizing that a dedicated recruit would never say “no” to an order Health care systems and residency programs across the country must lead from the front, creating increased protections for our physician trainees during this pandemic. They are the future of health care in the United States and without them, we are lost.

80,80,"What schools will look like when they reopen: Scheduled days home, more online learning, lots of hand-washingErin Richards ","May 29, 2020",https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/education/2020/05/28/coronavirus-schools-reopen-online-homeschool/5194480002/,"Imagine, for a moment, American children returning to school this fall. The school week looks vastly different, with most students attending school two or three days a week and doing the rest of their learning at home. At school, desks are spaced apart to discourage touching. Some classrooms extend into unused gymnasiums, libraries or art rooms – left vacant while schools put on hold activities that cram lots of children together. Arrival, dismissal and recess happen on staggered schedules and through specific doors to promote physical distancing. Students eat lunch at their desks. Children learn with the same peers every day – or teachers move around while students stay put – to discourage mingling with new groups. Teachers and other education staff at higher risk of contracting the virus continue to teach from home, while younger or healthier educators teach in-person.  Everyone washes their hands. A lot. Frequently touched school surfaces get wiped down. A lot. That outline of a potential school day was drawn from interviews with more than 20 education leaders determining what reopened schools might look like come fall. New guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention supports those plans and more: Teachers and older students should wear masks, especially when they have to interact in close quarters. In the absence of a vaccine for COVID-19, social distancing and hygiene will be important to limit spreading the virus. The question is how to successfully implement those measures in schools usually filled with crowded hallways, class sizes of more than 30 people and lunchrooms of hundreds.  ""The whole thing is overwhelming,"" said Dan Weisberg, a former district official and the head of TNTP, a nonprofit formerly known as The New Teacher Project that helps districts recruit and hire more effective teachers. ""This is where federal dollars could help,"" Weisberg said. ""This is where state guidance could help. This is where galvanizing people behind the idea on how to plan for next year could help."" When will schools reopen?Not soon, education leaders say, despite Trump's declarations The new CDC guidance on reopening the economy, a 60-page document released in the third week of May, recommends that schools place desks six feet apart, serve lunch in classrooms, close playgrounds, keep children in the same groups every day and cancel field trips and extracurricular activities. It also recommends daily health checks and temperature screenings of staff and students daily, if feasible. A few U.S. schools have cautiously returned to in-person instruction. In California's Marin County, three school buildings opened May 18 to serve the most needy students: those with disabilities, and those who had fallen off track in high school and were not participating remotely. Teachers wearing masks worked with eight cohorts of 12 students across the three schools, officials said. Students washed their hands on arrival, and tape marks in classrooms reminded some to keep their distance. New cellphone sign-in systems track who comes in and out, which means contact tracing can begin promptly if an infection is detected. In Montana, 11 schools reopened after Gov. Steve Bullock turned such decisions over to districts this month.  Willow Creek School, located 40 miles west of Bozeman, reopened on May 7. The tiny K-12 school enrolls 56 students; only 37 returned for in-person instruction.  On a recent afternoon, teachers supervised recess while wearing cloth face masks and holding 6-foot pool noodles. When recess ended, students lined up on orange circles spray-painted on the sidewalk at evenly marked intervals. As the line moved inside, each student was met at the door with a squirt of hand sanitizer.   The school has implemented staggered schedules and separated desks. Younger students walk through hallways holding hula-hoops to prevent them from touching things.  Reopening schools is critical to fully bring back the economy. More parents can work when their children are in school. Just as important: Many kids aren't learning much at home. Those learning the least are students who lack devices and internet access. 'Historic academic regression':Why homeschooling is so hard amid school closures Bringing kids back to school presents major worries about health, not so much for children – who seem to be less at risk for getting sick – but fortheir teachers and parents. Preliminary research has shown that children can carry and transmit the virus without showing symptoms themselves.  Many school buildings lack the space to keep children a recommended six feet apart. That's why education leaders foresee a need to continue virtual learning, with kids attending school in person on alternating days or weeks. And that's only the start. Districts also must figure out food service, especially for the 52% of students who qualify for free- or reduced-price lunches and depend on those meals. Schools must provide enough qualified staff to teach students in smaller groups. They must provide emotional support to staff and students. And they need to develop measures to help catch up children who have fallen the farthest behind. Then schools have to figure out how to pay for it all. ""Economics will drive the choices districts make,"" said Marguerite Roza, a professor and director of the Edunomics Lab at Georgetown University. Superintendents from 62 of the country's largest school districts have called on Congress to provide about $200 billion more in educational stabilization funds. ""Not only are we going to be faced in the fall with a shortfall of revenues, but we’ll have to be spending considerably more on transportation, on masks, on cleaning, on additional bus routes,"" said Mike Casserly, executive director of the Council of the Great City Schools, which represents large, urban public school systems. Schools have become a key resource for families needing food assistance, which will likely continue no matter what schooling scenario takes shape. Many districts have lost money because they're providing meals to needy adults as well as children, and they can only claim reimbursement from the federal government for student meals. Without a federal bailout, school food programs will be forced to make cuts, meaning there may be fewer cafeteria workers to prepare meals. Schools will also have to figure out how to prepare and serve foods in buildings while adhering to social distancing measures. “Most of our school nutrition directors have been working through their (non-perishable) inventory to make sure nothing is wasted,""  said Diane Pratt-Heavner, spokeswoman for the nonprofit School Nutrition Association, ""but that means that when they get back to school they won’t have any reserves.”  Skylar Rispens with the Great Falls Tribune and Daphne Duret with the USA TODAY Network contributed to this report.

81,81,"New Notre Dame fall semester calendar keeps football in a hypothetical mode, but with hopeEric Hansen ","May 19, 2020",https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaf/independents/2020/05/18/notre-dame-fighting-irish-football-has-hope-fall-2020-season/5218741002/,"Piecing together what Notre Dame president Rev. John I. Jenkins’ re-imagined fall semester on campus might mean to sports — particularly football — starts, predictably, with a hypothetical. And some math. And unaccidental silence on the topic from Jenkins himself in a news release that dropped late Monday afternoon. In it, Jenkins outlines a fall term that will start with in-person classes two weeks early (on Aug. 10), eliminate fall break in October, and finish before Thanksgiving in response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. There will be no summer classes on campus either, with a few exceptions — a certainty previously through the first summer term and now extended to its second term. Roughly two weeks ago, though, Notre Dame athletic director Jack Swarbrick presented a hypothetical that could allow football players and other fall sports athletes to return to campus for training ahead of the general student population. That’s not a given at this point — and Swarbrick was not available for comment Monday for an update — but the possibility of it keeps the concepts of both a full football season and one that starts on time both in play for the Irish. Notre Dame is scheduled to open the 2020 season Aug. 29 against Navy in Dublin, Ireland, though venue alternatives in the U.S. have been explored. The slated regular-season finale is two days after Thanksgiving, Nov. 28 at USC. LANE KIFFIN BOWL? USC, Ole Miss announce home-and-home football series for 2025, 2026 MORE:If Pac-12 eliminates non-conference football games, other conferences will need a Plan B CORONAVIRUS & SPORTS:Get the latest news and information right in your inbox. Sign up here. “We’ve all agreed that six and, more likely seven, weeks will be required to safely prepare the football team,” Swarbrick said in a Zoom conference with the media on May 5. “So in the interest of safety, as with the decision to open the dorms, you’d have to figure out a way to assemble those students, to put them in an environment that’s safe, whether it’s a residence hall or you make other accommodations to feed them and to prepare them for the season.” Jenkins’ vision for how that will work for the general student population in the fall seems to be a template that would work if Notre Dame coaxed the student-athlete scenario from the “if” stage into reality. From the release: Students, faculty and staff will undergo comprehensive testing for COVID-19. Contact tracing, quarantine and isolation protocols, social distancing and mask requirements, and enhanced cleaning of all campus spaces are all part of the plan as well. The university has identified facilities to isolate students who test positive, and quarantine students who have been in close contact. Testing, contact tracing and the quarantine/isolation protocols will continue throughout the semester and as long as necessary. “As we adapt to the new normal brought on by the coronavirus, we will do everything we can to provide you with a safe learning, research and working environment,” Jenkins said, adding that the university “will monitor developments and alter plans should a serious outbreak occur, or should it be unable to acquire what is needed for testing.” So football is still a great, big “I don’t know,” just as most of life beyond June 1 seems to be, but the blueprints to make it happen are gaining significant momentum and detail, and not just in South Bend. Along those lines, on Wednesday the NCAA’s Division I Council is expected to lift its nationwide ban on on-campus summer activities, per Sports Illustrated’s Ross Dellenger, with student-athletes able to return to campuses as soon as next month, where state and local COVID-19 regulations allow. Meanwhile, NCAA Division II will allow in-person recruiting, camps and clinics on campus for the month of June, provided they don’t clash with local health guidelines and conference decisions. Notre Dame didn’t specify the methodology for deciding to eliminate fall break and to keep students from returning to campus after Thanksgiving, but clues as to why can be found in a release issued earlier in the day by the University of South Carolina, which announced a similar fall-semester structure. • Canceling Fall Break — the public health risks associated with thousands of students and faculty returning to campus after Fall Break travels could be significant for the campus and Columbia communities and could jeopardize the continuation of the semester. • Remote learning following Thanksgiving Break — our best current modelling predicts a spike in cases of COVID-19 at the beginning of December, which also will likely coincide with traditional flu season.” Notre Dame has its own guiding principles and cadre of health experts to guide it down a path that still has no real frame of reference. Bringing football players back to campus to condition before the general student population — particularly with the right testing/tracing/quarantine strategy makes sense, given that the alternative. With gyms opening up in many states, those environments figure to have much less structure and control than what could be provided at Notre Dame. ND has the staff to make this happen, the facilities to make it happen, the ability to stagger players at different times, and the desire to make it happen. That doesn’t mean there won’t be more questions and possibly setbacks. And the fan experience, whatever that looks like, has even more challenges to work through. But football in 2020 had to start somewhere. And starting — knowing there’s a safety net and an emergency brake — is an admirable undertaking. “Bringing our students back is, in effect, assembling a small city of people from many parts of the nation and the world, who may bring with them pathogens to which they have been exposed,” Jenkins said. “We recognize the challenge, but we believe it is one we can meet.” Follow the South Bend Tribune's Eric Hansen on Twitter @EHansenNDI."
82,82,"‘A national disgrace’: 40,600 deaths tied to US nursing homesMarisa Kwiatkowski, Tricia L. Nadolny, Jessica Priest and Mike Stucka ","Jun. 2, 2020",https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/investigations/2020/06/01/coronavirus-nursing-home-deaths-top-40-600/5273075002/,"The Feb. 29 death of a Washington state nursing home resident signaled a warning to long-term care facilities throughout the country. The coronavirus was no longer a specter; it was here and it could sweep through a vulnerable population, leaving a trail of grief. Yet facilities and government leaders were still unprepared for the onslaught of COVID-19 cases and deaths. Dozens more would die at the facility in Kirkland, Washington. The same staggering loss hit home after home: 81 deaths at the New Jersey Veterans Home at Paramus; 76 deaths at Brighton Rehab and Wellness Center in Pennsylvania; 60 deaths at the Courtyard Nursing Care Center in Massachusetts. Over the last three months, more than 40,600 long-term care residents and workers have died of COVID-19 – about 40% of the nation’s death toll attributed to the coronavirus, according to an analysis of state data gathered by USA TODAY. That number eclipses a count released Monday by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), the federal government’s first attempt at a comprehensive tally. CMS said 25,923 residents had died, but its number only includes federally regulated nursing homes, not assisted living facilities.  Even USA TODAY’s larger total – which amounts to roughly 450 COVID-19 elder care facility deaths per day – is an undercount. Seven states did not provide the number of deaths in long-term care. And New York, the state with the most resident deaths, doesn’t include those who had been transferred to hospitals in its count of long-term care fatalities. We want to hear from you:What is happening at your nursing home? The incomplete picture of the problem and the deficiencies that contributed to that devastating death toll – such as limited testing, a lack of personal protective equipment and lax infection control – remain a significant hurdle. As states lift restrictions on life outside of nursing homes’ doors, experts worry the threat of the virus getting inside facilities is only increasing. ""We're at a very fragile point right now,"" said Katie Smith Sloan, president and CEO of LeadingAge, a national association of nonprofit providers of aging services. ""Because as states and communities begin to reopen, we still have no more than a patchwork plan for protecting older lives."" More than 2.4 million people live in long-term care settings, including the nation’s roughly 15,400 federally regulated nursing homes and nearly 42,400 assisted living communities, according to the American Health Care Association and National Center for Assisted Living. To date, 37 states have released at least partial lists of facilities with cases of COVID-19, but many were slow to make that move. Texas, Virginia and Arizona are among the states that still do not release facility-level data. Search USA TODAY's database of publicly disclosed facilities with COVID-19 cases. CMS said it would be releasing the facility-specific information it collected later this week. But about 20% of facilities did not report information, the agency said. And though CMS said it has encouraged nursing homes to report all cases and deaths, it only required numbers going back to early May. In a statement, a CMS spokeswoman said the agency has been proactive in communicating with nursing homes and offering guidance throughout the pandemic. On Monday, the agency announced more aggressive infection control measures, including increasing fines for persistent violations and withholding funds from states that don’t inspect every nursing home in the coming months. Nursing homes struggled with infection control far before the pandemic. Seventy-five percent of U.S. nursing homes have been cited for failing to properly monitor and control infections in the past three years, according to a  USA TODAY analysis of federal inspection data. On Feb. 6, as fears about the coronavirus mounted, CMS reminded facilities of the importance of infection control practices, including things as basic as hand-washing and wearing gloves. Less than two weeks later, a nurse at Life Care Center of Kirkland raised concerns about a cluster of residents with respiratory infections, according to federal inspection records. No one reported it to county health officials until Feb. 26. Meanwhile, more and more residents became ill. In total, more than 110 residents and staff at the facility would test positive for COVID-19. By the time the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued its report on the outbreak on March 18, COVID-19 had infiltrated nursing homes across the country. Today, more than 9,600 long-term care facilities have reported at least one case of COVID-19, according to USA TODAY’s analysis. More than 208,000 people at those facilities have tested positive. That number includes at least 38,600 employees. ""What’s happening in nursing homes today and other long-term care facilities is a national disgrace,"" Nancy LeaMond, executive vice president and chief advocacy and engagement officer at the AARP, said last week during an event hosted by Axios. ""On Feb. 29, Washington state reported the first COVID-19 outbreak in a long-term care facility and here we are, three months later, and we still don’t have a solid, consistent action plan across the country."" Cloaked in a paper gown and face mask, Maria Porteus watched the slow rise and fall of her father’s chest as he lay propped in bed at Luxor Nursing and Rehab at Mills Pond, a New York nursing home. His breathing sounded like firecrackers.   Two weeks earlier, on March 25, Luxor had followed a directive from Gov. Andrew Cuomo and accepted a hospital patient who had tested positive for COVID-19. Porteus said she wasn’t told. If she had been, she says she or her brother would have brought their father, Carlos Gallegos, to live with them at home. Instead, she said she first learned that the facility had cases of COVID-19 when a nurse called to say her father was running a 102-degree fever. On April 9, she and her brother stood at the foot of his bed and touched his blanketed feet with their gloved hands. He died later that night.   A spokesman for the facility said Luxor’s staff were deeply saddened by Gallegos’ death but would not comment on how he contracted the virus.   ""I would be at peace if this had been God's will,"" Porteus said through tears. ""But this didn't have to happen."" The first months of the pandemic have been marked by complaints from families who say they have been kept in the dark about what is happening in their loved ones' facilities. Lori Smetanka, executive director of the National Consumer Voice for Quality Long-Term Care, said she is concerned about the amount of information available to the public and the fact that CMS only required facilities to report numbers going back to early May. ""That leaves almost three months of kind of a black hole where we don't have data on what's been happening in these facilities in some cases,"" she said. ""We can't successfully move forward and look at not only what happened, but what we can do to improve, if we don't have the data."" There are inconsistencies both in what is being tracked and what is being released at the state level. In Michigan, the state health department for months failed to track COVID-19 cases in its more than 1,000 assisted living facilities. A spokeswoman said the state began collecting that information on May 22 but doesn’t have plans to release it publicly at this time. In New York, the state's official count of long-term care residents who have died doesn’t include those transferred to hospitals or other health care settings. Facilities are required to report those deaths to the state, but officials at the New York State Health Department said only deaths at the facility are included in the public tally to avoid double-counting. A spokesman said the state ""has provided the public with the clearest possible understanding"" of the virus' impact from the start of the pandemic. He did not respond to questions about how many deaths of long-term care residents have been reported by facility owners but not publicly disclosed by the state. Other states may also be undercounting long-term care fatalities. At least seven states – including Massachusetts, Florida and Louisiana – track deaths in part by matching the deceased’s address to the address of a care facility, potentially leaving out those who were staying at a facility short-term. And at least 17 states use information reported by facilities, with operators keeping track of residents who are transferred to a hospital. In Pennsylvania, officials released a list of 557 facilities with COVID-19 cases for the first time on May 19. Almost immediately, the state health care association said the list was riddled with mistakes and demanded the errors be fixed. State officials made numerous updates to the data, including lowering the number of deaths and cases at some facilities. Nate Wardle, spokesman for the department, said the state had relied upon its own disease surveillance system because many facilities either missed the May 17 deadline to report information to the state or provided current, not cumulative, numbers. ""We have recognized there were some issues with the initial report. We are working through those,"" Wardle said. ""In the future, this won’t be an issue because the facilities are going to be reporting the data themselves."" On Mother’s Day, visitors to River Garden Senior Services in Jacksonville, Florida, were given temperature checks at the guard booth before handing over the flowers and candy they brought for their loved ones. Their gifts were delivered by employees. CEO Martin Goetz said families haven‘t been allowed inside the facility since mid-March, and he doesn’t see that changing without regular testing, given that asymptomatic staff and visitors could unknowingly bring the virus on campus. The 600 residents and employees at his facility will be tested this week as part of a state plan to expand testing at long-term care facilities. But Goetz doesn’t know when that will happen again. He said he doesn’t believe River Garden has had any cases of COVID-19 and hopes testing will confirm that the facility is coronavirus-free. ""Without continuous testing and contact tracing and a stable environment out in the community, I will not open this campus,"" Goetz said. CMS last month outlined a cautious plan for reopening the nation’s nursing homes. Leaving the final decision up to state and local governments, the agency encouraged facilities to meet several criteria before relaxing restrictions on visitation, including having an adequate level of personal protective equipment and no new cases of COVID-19 within the home for four weeks. The plan also takes into account the prevalence of cases in the surrounding community.  The agency recommended weekly testing of staff and residents. Most states are far from hitting that benchmark, a USA TODAY survey of state health departments in mid-May found.   At least eight states – including Illinois, Minnesota, North Carolina and Nevada – said they were prioritizing testing either in facilities with confirmed cases or when individuals exhibit symptoms. About 14 states – including Kentucky, Maryland, and Wisconsin – are requiring testing of all residents and staff, regardless of the presence of an outbreak. New York is requiring staff be tested twice weekly. In West Virginia, the first state to commit to universal testing in long-term care communities, officials said testing across all 123 facilities identified 28 new homes with the virus. Several other states working toward universal testing recently told USA TODAY that the first round would not be complete until the end of May or early June, leaving questions about whether they could achieve the kind of regularity experts say is needed to keep COVID-19 out of facilities.   Jennifer Nuzzo, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, said state governments need to be doing more to help facilities not only ramp up testing but secure access to personal protective equipment, fill staffing gaps and address other daily challenges. She said she worries the conversation surrounding nursing homes – including efforts to publicly name those with cases – has been focused on placing blame rather than providing assistance to solve systemic problems.  ""I don't think it should come from a position of antagonism with these facilities,"" Nuzzo said. “It has to be a partnership with government. Regular eyes on these facilities. Have people visit them. Assess them on a routine basis to make sure they have exactly what they need. Having regular calls to identify problems early so that they can figure out solutions before outbreaks occur."" As communities begin to open up, Nuzzo said now is not the time to reopen nursing homes.   ""Nursing homes are not any safer today than they were a month ago, two months ago,"" she said. ""In fact, they are more vulnerable.""  Without an end in sight, home operators need to do more to connect residents with their loved ones outside, said Eric Carlson, a directing attorney at Justice in Aging. CMS in March encouraged nursing homes to make that a priority. But Carlson said the agency needs to require nursing facilities – which have received federal money to support their response to the pandemic – to use technology to make sure families stay connected. He also said more can be done under the current federal guidelines, which ban visitors except in certain ""compassionate cases.""  ""Some facilities have just read that very rigidly as including only end-of-life situations, and then further limiting that by defining end of life as the absolute end of life,"" he said. ""You'd like to see some more discretion in there, recognizing when it might be particularly important for a particular resident or residents to receive a visit from family members."" Patty  Ducayet, who has been Texas’s long-term care ombudsman for 14 years, said she sees a growing desperation among families, now separated from their loved ones for months. Children worry parents with dementia will forget who they are.   Ducayet  shares their concern and wonders: what is the path to residents again enjoying the comfort of a hug, to seeing the face of a loved one not filtered through a pane of glass. ""We have got to find a balance here, and we cannot isolate residents indefinitely,"" she said. ""We would be changing the fabric of our long-term care system. And it would be cruel.""

83,83,Opinion: Sports leagues should ignore President Trump — we can't have fans in stands yetGreg Moore ,"May 26, 2020",https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/columnist/2020/05/25/president-trump-stokes-foolish-optimism-fans-attending-sports/5254800002/,"Don’t take off your mask just yet, but we’re getting close. The NCAA has lifted its moratorium on college basketball and football. The NBA and MLB are mulling comebacks that could begin within weeks. And the NFL has a fair chance of starting as scheduled this fall. But everyone involved has to ignore President Donald Trump, who’s been dropping dangerous hints about having fans attend games, something scientists say will put us right back where we started in this nightmarish COVID-19 pandemic. “When Alabama has a football game against LSU, I don’t want 20,000 people in the stands with seven empty seats in between everybody,” Trump said this month in an interview with ABC News from the Honeywell factory in Phoenix. “I want 110,000 people like they got. And they get even more than that — that’s what I want. ... I hope it’s gonna be soon.” We all hope he’s right, of course. But anecdotal evidence and hard data are telling us that we shouldn’t even entertain fans as a possibility for the foreseeable future.   The Korea Baseball Organization has resumed play in empty stadiums. Germany’s soccer league, Bundesliga, is playing without spectators. And domestically, UFC and NASCAR are back in operation with no fans. The numbers, meanwhile, show that things are getting better, but the U.S. remains in the grip of the pandemic. The nation has had nearly 1.6 million cases and 95,000 deaths since the first case was reported in late January, according to Johns Hopkins University and Medicine data. Infection rates have slowed from a high of close to 35,000 cases a day last month to about 21,000 daily cases currently. But states have reopened, and the numbers are starting to tick back up.   Few things could be more dangerous than packing tens of thousands of strangers into close quarters for hours at a time — especially when flu season starts in October. Medical experts are warning of a second wave that could be more deadly than what we’ve already seen. “If we let our desire to prematurely get back to normal (guide us), we can only get ourselves right back in the same hole,” Trump’s top medical adviser, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said in a recent interview with the New York Times. He left open the possibility for a cautious return to sports — which we’re seeing. “We’ve got to make sure that when we try to get back to normal, including being able to play baseball in the summer and football in the fall and basketball in the winter, that when we do come back to some form of normality, we do it gradually and carefully,” he said. “And when cases do start to rebound — which they will, no doubt — that we have the capability of identifying, isolating and contact tracing.” He later said that leagues “if they’re going to play, play in front of a TV camera without people in the audience.”   The NCAA made a step toward return, saying that “Division I football and basketball student-athletes can participate in on-campus voluntary athletics activities beginning June 1 … as long as all local, state and federal regulations are followed.” The NBA is expected to release guidelines June 1 that could serve as a roadmap for getting back on the court to conclude the season. MLB has been in negotiations with the players’ union over how to split profits from potential games this summer. And the NFL, which optimistically could start in September, has taken a wait-and-see approach, with the league’s chief medical adviser, Dr. Allen Sills, saying, “we are not putting dates on the calendar at this point.” We all want sports back. It would be good for the nation’s psyche, a signal that if we do things properly we can get through this. But we simply can’t rush. Even if the staggering death toll and illness rates don’t give you pause, consider that we’re still trying to find ways to return to basic levels of humanity. Fathers are dying, and children can’t grieve together at funerals. Mothers are dying, quarantined on hospital gurneys with no one but strangers in masks and gloves to hold their hands. Children are dying, days after reporting symptoms but being turned away from overcrowded hospitals that have triage units set up in hallways. Rich people can stay safe at home and work remotely. Working-class people are getting infected on the job. Let’s applaud Trump for his optimism, but let’s also remind him of the responsibilities of his office. When the president drops hints, people take action. And if that action leads to fans in stands at sporting events, it could have grave consequences. We’ve come a long way, and we’re getting close. But it’s not smart to take your mask off just yet. Follow Greg Mooreon Instagram and Twitter @WritingMoore."
84,84,Las Vegas casino employees will be tested for coronavirus starting this weekKen Ritter ,"May 20, 2020",https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/news/2020/05/20/las-vegas-casino-reopening-employees-tested-coronavirus/5231491002/,"LAS VEGAS — Testing for the new coronavirus is due to start Thursday for the first of tens of thousands of Las Vegas casino employees being tapped for job callbacks before resorts reopen, according to a cooperative plan announced Tuesday by several casino companies and local tourism, hospital and union officials. State gambling regulators have not given the go-ahead or a date for the lifting of Gov. Steve Sisolak’s mid-March order closing all gambling establishments in Nevada to prevent groups from gathering and spreading coronavirus. But some resorts are aiming for June 1 reopening, and officials said testing will start with scheduled appointments for notified employees at the Las Vegas Convention Center. Employees will not be charged a fee. The goal is to collect up to 4,000 test samples for the COVID-19 illness per day, officials said. Results are expected within 48 hours, and employees who test positive will be referred to the Southern Nevada Health District for contact tracing. Costs for the testing were not disclosed in a joint announcement by MGM Resorts International, Caesars Entertainment, Boyd Gaming, University Medical Center, the Culinary Union Health Fund and the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority. “COVID-19 testing ensures that Culinary Union members are safe when they return to work,” said Geoconda Argüello-Kline, union secretary-treasurer. She called the health and safety of employees and guests the top priority. MGM Resorts and Caesars own most of the hotel properties on the Las Vegas Strip, which has more than 150,000 hotel rooms. Each company furloughed more than 60,000 employees in March. University Medical Center CEO Mason VanHouweling credited efforts of a task force of Nevada business leaders led by former MGM Resorts executive Jim Murren with helping marshal resources to boost testing capacity. Murren has called virus testing essential in restarting the state economy and recently told The Associated Press that he hoped authorities would be able to process 30,000 tests a day by June 1. Caesars chief executive Tony Rodio said his company’s employees will complete a questionnaire to determine their need for a COVID-19 test. State health officials on Tuesday reported more than 7,000 positive cases of COVID-19, and 365 deaths. For most people, the virus causes mild or moderate symptoms such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness including pneumonia and death. The vast majority of people recover."
85,85,"Puerto Rico to reopen businesses, beaches, churches with new rules","May 22, 2020",https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/news/2020/05/22/puerto-rico-reopen-businesses-beaches-new-rules/5242560002/,"Puerto Rico will cautiously reopen beaches, restaurants, churches, hair salons and retail stores next week under strict new rules as the U.S. territory emerges from a two-month lockdown that stifled business activity on an island already beset with economic woes. Gov. Wanda Vázquez announced Thursday that most businesses will reopen on Tuesday, but a 7 p.m-to-5 a.m. curfew will remain in place until June 15. All people will be required to wear a mask when outside or inside a business, regardless of what they are doing. “Puerto Rico is facing a new way of life,” she said. “It’s the right time ... We have flattened the curve.” Many Puerto Ricans, including business owners, cheered the highly anticipated announcement. Health experts, however, warned that the government has not tested enough people or conducted enough contact tracing and is not prepared for a possible spike in new infections. In addition, most of the re-openings contradict recommendations made by a government-appointed medical task force. Puerto Rico’s Health Department has reported more than 2,900 confirmed COVID-19 cases and at least 126 deaths, and dozens of additional infections still emerge every day. Officials do not regularly update statistics, including how many people have been tested or how many have recovered. Until recently, the island had a lower per-capita testing rate than any U.S. state. Mónica Feliú-Mójer, spokeswoman for CienciaPR, a nonprofit group of Puerto Rican scientists who seek widespread testing, said she was concerned that the government’s data did not show that COVID-19 is under control. Vázquez said the restricted reopenings will protect people but also provide desperately needed economic relief on an island hit by hurricanes and earthquakes. The resumption of some normal activities also comes as the government restructures some of its more than $70 billion public debt load after declaring the largest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history in 2015. Restaurants will be allowed to operate at 25% capacity. Hair salons and barber shops will welcome clients by appointment only. People doing exercise, such as surfing, jogging, swimming or kayaking, will be allowed at the beach from 5 a.m. to 7 p.m. Retail stores will be allowed to reopen but under limited capacity, and people will be prohibited from trying on clothes, among other restrictions. Malls will open June 8. “You will not be allowed to stroll the halls like before,” the governor said. “There will be lanes ... We have to be disciplined.” Businesses that will remain closed for now include gyms and movie theaters, and all arriving flights are limited to Puerto Rico’s main international airport. Economist José Caraballo said that the lockdown, one of the strictest in any U.S. jurisdiction, has caused estimated economic losses ranging from $6 billion to $12 billion. The unemployment rate has spiked to an estimated 40% on an island of 3.2 million people with a poverty rate of more than 40%, higher than any U.S. state. Unlike in the aftermath of hurricanes Maria and Irma and a recent string of earthquakes, Puerto Ricans cannot move to the U.S. mainland because of the pandemic, Caraballo said in a phone interview. “They are desperate,” he said. “The usual escape valve, which was migration, is closed.” Delays in the distribution of local and federal aid have also deepened the financial struggles of many Puerto Ricans affected by the natural disasters and the government’s ongoing bankruptcy-like process, which has led to austerity measures. “The government’s inefficiency has caused the social crisis we have right now,” Caraballo said. Public schoolchildren and those seeking pandemic unemployment assistance have been especially hurt by the pandemic. The government kept school cafeterias shut for almost two months, opting to offload its food to nonprofits and a local food bank, where it quickly ran out. That forced some teachers to buy food for their students with their own money. In addition, some 90,000 people applied for pandemic unemployment assistance when the funds became available on April 28, but an online system crashed. It was not until Thursday that the government said that the first 50,000 people began receiving payments. It’s unclear when the remaining applicants will receive the money. Some business owners did not feel like celebrating much. Hair stylist Anabel Fuentes said she lost up to $8,000 during the lockdown, and worries she will continue to lose money because she can only attend a limited number of clients now. “The financial problems will persist, and might even worsen and lead to bankruptcy,” she said. “Nothing will be the same.” Is international travel allowed yet?:See when popular destinations are reopening their borders"
86,86,"Health leaders: We stuck together to #StayHome, now we can start together to #OpenSafelyAndy Slavitt, Dr. Mark McClellan and 20 other health leaders ","May 20, 2020",https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2020/05/20/coronavirus-still-spreading-america-must-open-safely-column/5216824002/,"Americans want our country to open up safely. We have been at this for a number of difficult weeks since the global coronavirus pandemic began, and it has taken a toll. It has been a time of unprecedented challenge. To our health. To our jobs. To our social connections. To our health care communities. We have sacrificed with great unity to #StayHome in order to reduce the infection rate and save lives. We want a sense of normalcy back — to go to work, to go to restaurants, to see sports again, to send our kids to school, to hug our families — but not at the expense of the lives of our friends, families and neighbors. We want a good economy and public safety, but we are afraid if we open too quickly, or don’t have plans to adjust if spread recurs, we will have neither. We don’t believe we need to wait until everything is completely perfect or there is zero risk before we open again. The reality is that many states are already taking the first steps toward opening, and this must happen in the safest way possible. Americans should still #StayHome whenever possible and continue social distancing. Now we need to get on a path to #OpenSafely that gets it right. COVID-19 is still spreading, but at a steadier rate. While it is shrinking in places like New York, it is still growing rapidly in some areas where there had been fewer cases. The virus is still equally contagious. The virus is still lethal to many. The virus still spreads through unsuspecting asymptomatic people. Some places are especially hard hit: nursing homes, meatpacking plants, prisons, detention centers, public housing, and the communities around them as people move in and out. People are still dying at an alarming rate, and that will continue unless we follow the path like the one outlined by Dr. Deborah Birx at the White House: a steady, gated reopening that avoids accelerated growth in cases, hospitalizations and deaths. Tens of millions of Americans are now out of work. Many businesses have closed; others are in danger. Americans are facing hunger and the inability to pay their rent or mortgage at levels not seen here since the Great Depression. Congress and the administration have passed laws to support Americans through this, but support isn’t the same thing as a job. And the support still leaves voids that need to be filled. Yet opening the country before we have the conditions like those outlined in the White House plan can put Americans at risk unless we take further steps. It won’t help the economy if we end up having to pull back hard or close again because the virus starts spreading toward the point where it threatens our health care systems and further disrupts our health. The things that will bring us back — consumer spending, business hiring, signing leases, travel and capital investment — won’t happen unless Americans feel confident they can do these things without a substantial risk of harm to themselves or their loved ones from getting and spreading COVID-19. We are asking decision-makers at all levels to #OpenSafely — to move along the path of opening up our communities again as deliberately as necessary and as quickly as can be safely accomplished. Opening up safely means: ►Following the plan laid out by Dr. Birx to begin opening communities up with two weeks of declining case counts and the other gating criteria met — or explaining how there is an alternative plan for containment if that condition is not met. ►Creating adequate diagnostic testing availability so that people who need a test can get one — particularly people with symptoms, and those without symptoms in high-risk settings like nursing homes, prisons and meatpacking plants. ►Implementing improved safety standards and protocols to avoid outbreaks and slow spreading in potential hot spots. ►Having adequate public health infrastructure to contact trace and offer voluntary isolation to contain the virus when it is detected — not necessarily to trace all cases successfully, but enough to minimize potential outbreak clusters and keep getting better over time. ►Protecting vulnerable and at-risk populations and hard-hit communities, and not putting essential workers at needless risk. ►Obtaining sufficient personal protective equipment (PPE) to protect our first responders and health care workforce, including by expanding access to testing in the community As the reopening process begins and moves forward, states should be carefully monitoring hospitalization trends and their hospital capacity. If the rise in cases is on track to threaten hospitals’ capacity to care for COVID-19 or other acutely ill patients in the state, states should immediately take steps to slow or pause reopening efforts. The lag between infection and serious complications is typically eight days or more, so there is little time to wait if such trends emerge. Additional important areas to make progress on that will reduce risk of transmission and support continued opening up: ►Widespread use of high-quality masks. ►Surge capacity in the health care system with sufficient PPE to protect health care workers. ►Evidence-based mitigation measures and screenings in offices and public spaces, using guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or comparable ones. ►Controls at major air and rail entry points. ►Continuous monitoring at the state and county level for indications of potential emerging outbreaks, including symptom-checking apps, digital thermometers and other syndromic surveillance tools as they become available. ►Test, trace and isolate most active cases and their closest contacts, using vacant hotel space where necessary. ►Coordinated response with neighboring states. ►Widespread use of telemedicine to improve health care access and reduce the use of PPE. ►Readiness to respond quickly to new community spread. Areas that can most safely open up (with appropriate distancing and risk mitigation steps) if states have met the Dr. Birx gating criteria but have not yet initiated the reopening process are: ►Doctor offices, clinics and surgery centers with sufficient community PPE. ►Workplaces like retail and manufacturing. ►Parks and other outdoor recreation, lakes, gardens and bike trails. ►Shopping areas and coffee shops where people don’t congregate in large numbers or for extended periods. ►Outdoor weddings and funerals with small groups that physically distance and wear masks when close together.   Additional areas that we hope can open up successfully under significantly modified conditions, but that will benefit from further technical assessment on how processes should be modified that would allow them to operate with lower risks: ►Day care centers ►Summer camps and youth sports ►Restaurants ►Schools ►Movie theaters and small entertainment venues ►Sporting events with very limited or no crowds ►TV and film production ►Colleges and universities ►Bars Areas that should remain closed until risks can be significantly reduced: ►Large-scale events like concerts, sports with high attendance ►Large conventions and other activities involving significant travel and congregation We believe these lists can be refined and adjusted locally based on conditions, proximity to hot spots, density and other factors. We are asking public officials and decision-makers to #OpenSafely by quickly getting the conditions in place so we can move forward. We are encouraged that other countries, including Germany, Italy and New Zealand, as well as parts of the United States, are implementing strategies to begin to open safely and closely monitor a step-by-step opening. We believe a safe step-by-step opening can happen across the United States.  We believe Americans want to remain united in the fight against COVID-19, as we were in the initial response after 9/11. We can overcome this epidemic with smart policies and committed actions.

87,87,'We would like to get in there': Health officials frustrated as over 30 Amazon workers contract COVID-19Rory Linnane ,"May 21, 2020",https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2020/05/21/at-least-32-workers-amazon-kenosha-wisconsin-facilities-have-had-coronavirus/5236177002/,"MILWAUKEE – At least 32 workers at the Amazon campus in the nearby city of Kenosha have contracted coronavirus in the past two months, according to messages sent to employees and shared with the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. Amazon officials have not fully cooperated with public health workers trying to track cases, inform workers who might be at risk or offering testing and other safety measures, said Jen Freiheit, health officer for Kenosha County.  “We’re at the point now that since we’re not getting that, we’re going to look into what other measures we can take for Amazon, because we are not getting as far with compliance as we would like,” Freiheit said. If Amazon officials do not cooperate with health officials, Freiheit said she would consider attempting to shut down the Kenosha facilities, located in Wisconsin, south of Milwaukee and north of Chicago.  T-Mobile's free service deal:Provider wants to connect first responders with free cellular and data deal Costco mask clash:Customer asked to leave after refusing to wear a face covering Amazon has not provided an official total number of cases at its Kenosha facilities to county health officials and declined to provide the number to the Journal Sentinel. ""We are supporting the individuals who are recovering,"" Amazon spokeswoman Jen Crowcroft said in a statement. ""Our top concern is ensuring the health and safety of our employees."" The Journal Sentinel confirmed at least 32 cases at the Amazon facilities based on screenshots of text messages and voice messages sent by Amazon managers to employees as new cases were confirmed. Those messages were provided to the Journal Sentinel by workers. Workers told the Journal Sentinel they believe the number of positive cases is higher.  Amazon management has refused to say how many workers have tested positive nationwide at its workplaces. But Jana Jumpp, who is on leave from her job at an Amazon facility in Indiana, has been tracking cases across the country with the help of workers. As of Wednesday, Jumpp said she had confirmed 941 cases using screenshots of text messages and other verification methods. She was working on confirming another 94, she said. Seven Amazon employees, including a 50-year-old who worked at a Waukegan warehouse, have died from the virus, she said, the same number reported last week by the Indianapolis Star.  Amazon operates two facilities on its grounds east of Interstate 94 in Kenosha: MKE1, a 1 million-square-foot fulfillment center where workers receive products and send off packages; and MKE5, a sorting center that’s half that size.  Workers concerned for their safety or needing to care for family members were temporarily able to take unlimited time off due to the pandemic, but that policy was suspended May 1. Workers can still request a leave of absence, but some have reported being unable to get through on the phone lines to apply or being told they don’t qualify, according to Jumpp and social media posts. The first cases of coronavirus were confirmed at both facilities in late March, according to workers who asked not to be named for fear of retribution.  A spokesperson for Amazon said the company started recommending workers wear masks April 4 and started requiring them April 16.  At the smaller facility, MKE5, Amazon did not provide enough masks for everyone until masks were required, according to a worker there who serves on a Bubble Brigade – a team that’s supposed to enforce social distancing and other safety measures.  Amazon officials said the company expects to spend $800 million in the first half of this year on COVID-19 safety measures, including personal protective equipment, disinfectant spraying, social distancing measures that slow down productivity and in-house testing.  But the MKE5 worker on the Bubble Brigade said safety measures haven't worked as well in practice as she had hoped. For example, she is one of several employees now tasked with monitoring thermal cameras that measure employees’ temperatures as they enter. But she said she can't always catch everyone.  “If there’s several people coming through, sometimes they’re through before you can see them,” she said.  The worker, who falls into an at-risk category for coronavirus, said she volunteered to be part of the Bubble Brigade because she hoped it would be safer than other jobs where workers are in closer proximity to each other. But she said it’s hard to enforce safety measures without more support from managers, who she said often aren’t wearing masks.  “People continually take down their face masks and talk; they wear them on their neck,” she said. “When people go in the break room, they take off their face masks and we have a whole break room full of people without face masks.”  Coronavirus:Amazon warehouse worker in New York died of COVID-19 Workplace activism:Amazon VP quits in protest over warehouse employee firings A worker at the larger facility, MKE1, said the masks provided by managers are too large for many workers and often slide down. She also said it’s impossible to keep a safe distance of at least 6 feet away from other workers.  “With all the volume we’ve been getting, all the lines the packages come down get overpacked,” she said. “There’s been points where they’d have 17 people on one line shoulder to shoulder.”  Freiheit said she didn't know whether workers had proper masks or were properly distanced.  ""That’s why we would like to get in there,"" she said.  At the Kenosha County Division of Health, Freiheit said she is aware of 14 to 16 cases, but she only finds out about people who live in Kenosha County and many employees live elsewhere. Staff members have been unable to get consistent numbers from Amazon.  Amazon officials have said the rates of infection in their facilities are at or below rates in surrounding communities.  In Kenosha County, about 0.5% of the population has tested positive for coronavirus. Amazon officials would not say how many people work at the Kenosha facilities but said the company has more than 3,500 workers in Wisconsin, which also includes three Whole Foods stores and six other facilities. A conservative estimate of 32 cases out of 3,500 workers puts the rate at 0.9%, higher than the county rate. Freiheit, who has not been able to find out the total number of employees, said she can't tell how severe the outbreak is without having these numbers.  Health Department staff have also faced roadblocks with contact tracing, she said, the process public health workers use to track down people who may have had contact with coronavirus patients. For every positive Amazon employee from Kenosha County, staff has asked Amazon managers for a list of employees who had contact with the person. In some cases, they have not received a list, Freiheit said. In an open Facebook group for the facilities, employees discussed never being contacted despite working near other workers who tested positive.  A county health department offer to help with on-site safety measures was rebuffed, Freiheit said. The department has helped with worker protection at more than 260 businesses in the county, she said. Freiheit would like to be able to test every worker at Amazon. She said her staff has extended that offer over the phone, but she’s never sure if they’re reaching the right manager at the facilities. She could get assistance from the Wisconsin National Guard to conduct testing, she said. “If they’re open to it, I can immediately get the National Guard to come.”  Freiheit said ordering the facility to close would be a last resort if Amazon officials do not cooperate.  “I wouldn’t want to strong-arm anybody,” she said. “We want Amazon to work with us. We’re just having a difficult time even getting to that conversation.”  Workers are frustrated by the company’s response to the pandemic.  Initially, managers at the Kenosha facilities were telling workers exactly how many people had contracted the virus.  But after May 10, the texts to workers at MKE1 stopped specifying a number, causing workers to worry about how much the virus was spreading.  “We have additional confirmed cases of COVID-19 at MKE1,” read a text delivered Tuesday.  Jumpp said managers at other facilities also changed the way they report cases after May 10, when CBS aired a ""60 Minutes"" program about Amazon's treatment of employees.  Though many workers at the Kenosha facilities are unhappy with the communication and working conditions, they have not been as active in protests as workers at other Amazon facilities, who have walked off the job.  “Everybody’s afraid,” said a worker at MKE5. “They can make life real miserable for people doing any kind of activism.” In New York, Mayor Bill de Blasio has called for an investigation into Amazon’s dismissal of Chris Smalls, a worker who helped organize a worker walkout.  Smalls, who was not an organizer before the pandemic, said he’s now working to form an organization: The Congress of Essential Workers. He plans to ask Amazon workers to donate $1 per paycheck to the group for a strike relief fund and a food pantry for workers, with the ultimate goal of negotiating with Amazon executives over employee pay, benefits and treatment.  Smalls is now circulating a petition to extend hazard pay and unpaid time-off options for Amazon workers. The pay bump of $2 per hour is set to expire at the end of this month.  The worker at MKE5 said it’s hard to organize workers at Amazon.  “There’s talk of it all the time,” she said. “The problem is we’re all strung out, pushed to the limit, there’s just no energy left. They wear people out, wreck their knees, shoulders, backs and replace them.”  But, she said, “In my mind, if you were going to organize, this would probably be the best time to do it.""    Follow Rory Linnane on Twitter@RoryLinnane. "
88,88,3 reasons coronavirus testing is not a magic wand for businesses looking to reopen safelyDr. Joshua Sharfstein and Dr. Lisa Maragakis ,"May 18, 2020",https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2020/05/18/coronavirus-testing-not-enough-to-reopen-economy-safely-column/5209647002/,"As the pressure to reopen the economy intensifies, business leaders are searching for ways to reduce the risk of COVID-19 infection for their workers and customers. An alluring idea is to offer testing on site, keeping those who are positive out of the workplace. Testing seems to offer a combination of confidence building for employees and liability protection for companies. Some employers are even pursuing mandatory testing, which is permitted by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.  So, should universal testing in the workplace become part of the new normal?  Not yet. Given technical and resource limitations, testing is no more than one piece of the puzzle of infection prevention and control. There are three major reasons why it would be a mistake for employers to rely heavily or exclusively on testing for safety: ►Sufficient testing is difficult to put in place at even moderate scale. Testing for active SARS-CoV-2 infection is based on identifying the genetic material of the virus in a sample taken from the back of the throat or the nose. (Saliva testing also is promising.) For one person at a time, with certain machines, results are possible within as little as 15 minutes. When dozens or hundreds of samples are needed, however, samples need to be run in tandem on larger machines, and the results are likely to take hours.  If you ask people to wait a day for the results, that’s another day when latent infection could manifest itself, and another test would be needed. And so on. New rapid “antigen” tests are unlikely to solve this problem, given weaknesses with their accuracy. Pooling saliva samples from the whole workplace is a potential way to search for the coronavirus at lower cost. This strategy, however, takes additional time for sample collection and laboratory work. It also requires follow-up testing should the pooled sample prove positive. ►Negative test results do not eliminate the risk of COVID-19 transmission in the workplace. The accuracy of the test depends on when it is performed in an individual’s course of infection. Many asymptomatic people with SARS-CoV-2 infection could test negative — especially if they are in the pre-symptomatic but infectious phase. As a result, even the world’s most robust testing program would not eliminate the need for social distancing within an office or retail setting. One missed infection in someone who attends a packed staff meeting will require the whole office to quarantine. COVID protection: Workplaces aren't ready for mass reopening. First we need standards to keep workers safe. ►Employer testing at scale could lead to shortages of testing supplies and compromise the ability of health care facilities to test people who develop symptoms. Consultants offering testing to businesses may go straight to suppliers of swabs, reagents and testing machines and outbid public health agencies and clinics. If even a fraction of workplaces attempts regular testing, the demands could far exceed capacity. Less testing of those at greatest risk of infection will mean fewer opportunities for isolation, contact tracing and quarantine, the core components of controlling community spread. As cases in a community rise, so too will the likelihood of infections penetrating every workplace. Rather than as a magic wand, employers should look at testing as a potential piece of a comprehensive infection prevention and control strategy.  Employers should provide generous sick leave and quarantine benefits, screen employees and customers for symptoms before they come to the workplace, and reengineer the work environment to maintain at least 6 feet of distance and high levels of ventilation. They should focus on ways to promote hand hygiene, social distancing, environmental disinfection, and rapid identification and contact tracing for employees who develop COVID-19. False choice:Protesters should demand coronavirus safety and a reopened economy. We can have both. Regular testing is most appropriate for small cohorts of people who are unable to socially distance at work and who are exposed to the public in close quarters. Indeed, such testing could prove to be of high utility in very high-risk settings, such as nursing homes. Broad testing is also important in the setting of an outbreak, as directed by public health agencies. Testing alone, however, is insufficient as an infection prevention and control strategy. A test might find the novel coronavirus, but only careful planning, policy changes, reengineering the workplace and social distancing can stop it from spreading. There are no shortcuts to defeating COVID-19. Dr. Joshua Sharfstein is vice dean for Public Health Practice and Community Engagement at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.

89,89,"Park changes, social-distancing lifeguards, pear plant outbreak: News from around our 50 statesFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports ","Jun. 2, 2020",https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/06/02/park-changes-social-distancing-lifeguards-pear-plant-outbreak-news-around-states/111894910/,"Montgomery: The city might become the state’s latest to require the wearing of face masks in public amid rising COVID-19 cases. Montgomery Mayor Steven Reed said Friday that the proposal may be brought to the City Council as soon as Tuesday. Birmingham currently has an ordinance requiring face masks in public. The Birmingham City Council on Friday voted to extend the ordinance through June 12. “I don’t go from encouragement to enforcement very easily,” Reed said. “However, right now we have not seen the behavior that we need to see, nor have we seen the data showing us that the encouragement approach is working.” Montgomery has become an emerging hot spot for coronavirus. State Health Officer Scott Harris said last week that there is evidence of community spread instead of cases being linked to a singular location, like a nursing home, or an event. Anchorage: The state on Sunday reported 27 new coronavirus cases, the largest one-day increase reported since the start of the pandemic. Cases have spiked since Gov. Mike Dunleavy, a Republican, loosened restrictions put into place to guard against the virus’s spread. The state on April 24 began easing restrictions on businesses. Most restrictions on businesses were lifted May 22, though some local governments opened later. Dunleavy said at the time that he expected case numbers would rise and that the state would respond to any spikes or clusters. Sunday’s count was the most single-day cases since 22 were reported April 6. This comes after 13 new cases were reported Thursday, which was the state’s first double-digit increase in cases in six weeks. The state now has a total of 460 cases involving residents. Its death count remains at 10, and a death attributed to COVID-19 hasn’t been recorded since May 5. Eloy: Immigrants detained at the La Palma Correctional Center have become increasingly desperate as the coronavirus outbreak at the facility has grown into one of the biggest in the nation. At least 76 undocumented immigrants detained at the 3,060-bed detention center had tested positive for COVID-19 as of Saturday. That is sixth-largest coronavirus outbreak at an immigration detention facility in the country, according to Immigration and Customs Enforcement. La Palma Correctional Center, a former prison, is run by the private, for-profit company CoreCivic, under a contract with ICE. The outbreak at La Palma has become increasingly concerning in light of two detainees’ recent deaths of coronavirus complications at other detention centers. In letters written to relatives and immigration advocates, detainees, some with medical conditions, say they are fearful of becoming infected and dying because they don’t have any way to social distance. Little Rock: The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Arkansas has surpassed 7,000, and one additional death is reported due to COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, the Arkansas Department of Health said. The department had reported at least 7,253 cases and 133 deaths by Monday morning, up from 6,777 cases and 132 deaths reported Friday. The true number is likely higher because many people have not been tested, and studies suggest people can be infected and not feel sick. The state health department reported that 5,275 people have recovered from the virus and that 115 were hospitalized, versus 113 hospitalizations reported Friday. Palm Springs: Two months after Gov. Gavin Newsom announced the state would be the nation’s first placed under a stay-at-home order lasting “many, many months,” he began rolling back restrictions in favor of reopening businesses. But when counties initially couldn’t meet stringent reopening metrics, Newsom loosened those criteria. Counties soon began receiving the green light to restore portions of their economies even though many regions still struggled to show a significant downward trend in COVID-19 cases and lacked resources to track and respond to potential upticks. Of the 49 counties that received approval to speed along this quicker path to normalcy, 49% failed to meet at least one of the reopening criteria mandated by the state, according to an analysis by the Palm Springs Desert Sun. Nearly a third of the counties that received authorization didn’t have enough contact tracers, and more than 20% failed to conduct enough coronavirus tests on a daily basis. Fort Collins: The more than 4 million visitors who flock to Rocky Mountain National Park each year will see significant changes as the park balances visitors’ safety with their love of nature while reopening after its COVID-19 shutdown. National Park Service sites have taken a financial hit as many closed for two months or more. Rocky Mountain National Park – the third-most-visited national park – partially reopened Wednesday after shutting down March 20. Kyle Patterson, spokesperson for the park, said last year it collected about $2 million in entrance and campground fees from mid-March through May. Without that revenue and with new Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines in place that restricted the park’s ability to house and train seasonal workers, the park will only partially open some of its campgrounds and restrooms, while evaluating the opening of others. New London: Health care workers rallied Saturday to protest what they called a shortage of personal protective equipment and pay tribute to a nurse’s aide who died last month after contracting the coronavirus. Gov. Ned Lamont, Lt. Gov. Susan Bysiewicz and U.S. Rep. Joe Courtney, D-Conn., joined workers for Lawrence + Memorial Hospital and the Visiting Nurses Association of Southeastern Connecticut for the rally. Union leaders said nurses, aides and other health care workers are risking their lives caring for COVID-19 patients while lacking sufficient protective gear such as masks and gowns to keep them safe. People at the rally also remembered Elva Graveline, a 52-year-old nurse’s aide at Lawrence + Memorial who contracted the coronavirus and died May 19. Hospital officials said in a statement Saturday that workers have not been without protective gear during the pandemic and credited staff for doing a “phenomenal job.” Wilmington: A federal judge and a federal appeals panel have rejected a request from a preacher for an emergency injunction to lift state restrictions on church worship to prevent spread of the coronavirus. Neither the ruling Friday from a judge in Wilmington nor the 2-1 ruling Saturday from the federal appeals court in Philadelphia end the matter. They only leave the restrictions in place while a judge considers the merits of the issue. Christopher Allan Bullock, a well-known Wilmington pastor and community activist, had requested an emergency injunction to lift the restrictions ahead of Sunday, which was Pentecost. Judge Colm Connolly said the pastor could not prove he would be irreparably harmed, a legal standard required for issuing an injunction. But he made clear in his ruling that Bullock’s claims “implicate one of our most treasured rights protected by the Constitution – the right to exercise freely one’s religion.” Washington: The district lowered the speed limit on streets to 20 miles per hour effective Monday, WUSA-TV reports. The change was made in an effort to keep D.C. streets safe during the pandemic and social distancing era after officials noted an increase in speeding on city streets. D.C.’s seven-day moving average for new coronavirus cases has dropped to 101 – the lowest number since April 6. Key Largo: The Florida Keys reopened for visitors Monday after the tourist-dependent island chain was closed for more than two months to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. As the Keys took down barriers, Miami-Dade County decided to keep its beaches closed because of protests in South Florida and across the country over the May 25 death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Roadblocks were taken down shortly after midnight near Key Largo, the northernmost island in the chain. Almost half of all workers in the Keys are employed by hotels, bars and other hospitality industries, and many of the rest are involved in commercial and sport fishing. Richard Stanczyk, owner of Bud N’ Mary’s marina in Islamorada, said the 40 captains who operate fishing boats out of the 76-year-old business have had virtually no customers for weeks and welcome the reopening of the area to visitors. Atlanta: Emergency officials in some coastal counties are nervously bracing for this year’s hurricane season amid new dangers posed by the coronavirus to people who would require help evacuating. “If we have to evacuate, it’s going to be a nightmare,” said Ty Poppell, director of the Emergency Management Agency in McIntosh County south of Savannah. Poppell said putting evacuees on a bus and maintaining 6 feet of space around each person to help prevent potential exposure to the virus would be a big problem. As of mid-May, the county was still working to update its hurricane response for the virus, Poppell said. In neighboring Liberty County, emergency management director Larry Logan said he didn’t have enough shelters to maintain social distance in case of a mass evacuation. He was concerned that fear of contracting the virus at a shelter would lead more residents to ignore any evacuation orders. Wailuku: The Maui County Liquor Control Department has issued a written notice of warning to Maui Brewing Co. after an investigation revealed the company violated state law by advertising free hand sanitizer with the sale of liquor. The department released a statement about the notice following its investigation last month into the made-in-house hand sanitizer and giveaway promotions, The Maui News reports. “It is short of subjecting Maui Brewing to an adjudicatory hearing,” the department said. Maui Brewing CEO Garrett Marrero has said the company – which sells food, alcoholic beverages, coffee, soda and merchandise – did not violate rules. It had offered a free 16-ounce hand sanitizer with the purchase of any to-go item, not just alcohol, after its Kihei and Lahaina restaurant locations closed in March amid the coronavirus pandemic. But the giveaway promotion was flagged by the state liquor department and led to an investigation. Boise: New data shows a recent spike in coronavirus cases has hit Latinos in rural Idaho, an already disproportionately affected community that makes up a third of the state’s cases where the race is known. Data collected from all seven Idaho public health districts has shown a majority of the people who have contracted the coronavirus in multiple Magic Valley counties are Latino, the Idaho Statesman reports. The report released Wednesday showed Latinos made up more than half of the positive coronavirus cases in Lincoln, Minidoka, Gooding, Jerome and Cassia counties. Lincoln County had the highest percentage in Magic Valley, with Latinos making up 78% of the county’s 33 COVID-19 cases. The data provided by other Idaho health districts also shows similar effects on Latino communities, the Statesman reports. Springfield: The state will offer free meals to school-age children at hundreds of sites this summer, using options such as home delivery and drive-thru distribution to ensure families that need help can get it during the pandemic. The Illinois State Board of Education said more organizations are needed to participate in the summer food program, as the number of families relying on the assistance for meals when school isn’t in session has increased due to the coronavirus outbreak. “COVID-19 has turned many families’ lives upside down,” said State Superintendent of Education Carmen Ayala. “Illinois’ summer meals programs help to ensure that one thing families do not have to worry about is where their children will get their next meal.” Ayala said schools have found safe and creative ways to provide food to students, including curbside pickup and providing meals for multiple days at one time. Families may locate their summer food site by calling (800) 359-2163, texting “FoodIL” to 877-877, or visiting summermealsillinois.org. Indianapolis: Central Indiana trash haulers have collected record levels of residential trash since a statewide stay-at-home order that’s now being eased took effect in March due to the coronavirus pandemic, officials said. In the wake of that trash surge, Indianapolis city workers and private trash-collecting contractors have experienced longer days for drivers, lengthy lines at the dumping site, increased repairs for hard-running trucks and higher expenses. Republic Services, which serves homes in Marion County and many of Indianapolis’ surrounding suburban counties, saw the volume of weekly residential trash increase 28% when colleges and schools closed and families began eating at home and ordering takeout, the Indianapolis Business Journal reports. Residents stuck at home also started spring cleaning that resulted in a surge of castoffs, which Republic said led to a 48% increase of trash in April. Des Moines: Another five people with COVID-19 have died, and there have been an additional 204 positive cases, the state reported Monday morning. The state confirmed 538 COVID-19-related deaths, an increase of five since the state’s tally at 10 a.m. Sunday. According to the state’s coronavirus.Iowa.gov website, two deaths were reported for Sunday. COVID-19 is the respiratory disease caused by the coronavirus. The state reported Monday that there were 19,688 confirmed cases of COVID-19, an increase of 204 since Sunday. Of the 19,688 people who have tested positive, 11,185 have recovered, according to the state. The total number of people tested is 159,292. Gov. Kim Reynolds announced last week that she will no longer be holding daily coronavirus news conferences. Instead, she plans to hold them on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Wichita: Hundreds of people in the state’s largest city flocked to bars and clubs on the first weekend they were open after Gov. Laura Kelly and local officials lifted restrictions meant to check the spread of the coronavirus. By 11 p.m. Friday, bars in the Old Town district of downtown Wichita were packing in customers for a celebration after being closed for two months, The Wichita Eagle reports. Knots of people moved through the streets, hugging friends they met and, in some cases, turning cartwheels. “It feels like a freaking high school reunion,” said Megan Gilbert, who works in Old Town and for a roofing company. “I’m seeing all of these people that it seems like I haven’t seen in years.” Kelly last week converted her directives for a phased reopening of the state’s economy into recommendations for local officials to follow. Her reopening plan would have kept bars and nightclubs closed over the weekend. Frankfort: More of the state’s parks are set to reopen this month. Four Kentucky State Park lodges – Lake Cumberland State Resort Park, Lake Barkley State Resort Park, Blue Licks Battlefield State Resort Park and Buckhorn Lake State Resort Park – that were previously designated as part of the state’s coronavirus emergency response will reopen June 8, Gov. Andy Beshear announced. A decline in cases of the virus means the lodging is no longer necessary for response efforts, officials said. Officials also plan to reopen Kentucky Horse Park on June 11. “We are making every effort to safely reopen tourism attractions across the commonwealth and offer in-state travel opportunities for Kentuckians to enjoy,” Beshear said. “The revenue generated from in-state travel will foster economic growth in local communities and help Kentucky rebound with a healthy economy.” Health officials still stress the need for masks and social distancing. New Orleans: The Audubon Zoo plans to reopen Wednesday with special guidelines in place designed to reduce the spread of the coronavirus. According to the guidelines announced by the zoo Friday, it will open at 25% capacity, and reservations will be required in order to keep numbers low and assist in keeping visitors spread out. “We look forward to reconnecting the community with the animals in our care,” Audubon Nature Institute President and CEO Ron Forman said in a statement. “While our doors were closed to help stop the spread of COVID-19, Audubon’s dedicated staff continued to provide outstanding care for our animals and parks.” The zoo said in a news release that it had consulted with other zoo and aquarium officials around the country and with experts at other museums and attractions in Louisiana to come up with its reopening plan. Portland: A federal judge has denied a motion in a lawsuit by some campground operators who believe a state quarantine order for out-of-state visitors is unconstitutional. The move came Friday, hours after the U.S. Department of Justice said it filed court papers in support of campground operators. The campgrounds sued in federal court saying they believe the rule treats Maine residents more favorably than out-of-state residents, and that is hurting them economically. U.S. District Judge Lance Walker on Friday denied a motion for a preliminary injunction, allowing the rule to stand while the lawsuit proceeds, the Portland Press Herald reports. Gov. Janet Mills, a Democrat, said that the quarantine is “a proven tool to prevent the spread of this deadly disease” and that the Justice Department is “making a concerted effort to undermine the health of the people of Maine.” College Park: The 12 state schools that constitute the University System of Maryland will use a mix of in-person and remote learning when they reopen in the fall. The system, which includes the flagship University of Maryland at College Park, announced a framework Friday for schools to respond to the coronavirus. Each school will announce its own specific plans in the next two weeks as to how they’ll adjust their calendars and classroom settings. The release said all schools will provide at least some on-campus, in-person instruction in combination with remote learning. Some schools may adjust calendars to start the fall semester as early as July so the semester can conclude by Thanksgiving. All schools will enact plans to reduce crowding in residence and dining halls. Boston: City officials are concerned that many Asian American residents may not be getting tested for the new coronavirus. Boston’s Chinatown zip code, where half the residents are of Asian descent, is one of the city’s neighborhoods with the lowest percentage of positive coronavirus cases, Marty Martinez, the city’s chief of Health and Human Services, told the Boston Globe. Only 13% of those tested were positive, compared to the citywide cumulative percentage of 26%. Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders make up just less than 10% of Boston’s population but account for only 4% of confirmed COVID-19 cases and 6% of deaths, according the newspaper. At the same time, black residents, who comprise 25% of the city’s population, account for 38% of COVID-19 infections and 35% of deaths, in cases where the race and ethnicity is known. Latinos make up nearly 20% of the Boston population and account for 25% of cases and 11% of deaths. Detroit: Public health officials worry future outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases could emerge in the state, as vaccination rates have dramatically fallen during the coronavirus pandemic. Vaccination rates for those 18 and younger fell by more than 20%, according to a study published by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Measles vaccinations in particular dropped about 76% among 16-month-old children. Other diseases include mumps, rubella, diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis, also known as whooping cough. Many parents worried about the virus have kept their young children home, doctors say. “I’m extremely concerned that anytime we see a drop-off in our vaccine rates that it does leave the door open for a potential outbreak,” Bob Swanson, director of the division of immunization at the Michigan Department of Public Health, told The Detroit News. Minneapolis: Minnesota health officials reported 10 new deaths from COVID-19 on Monday, raising the state’s death toll to 1,050 on the same day Gov. Tim Walz allowed restaurants and bars to start offering outdoor dining. Salons and barbershops were also able to reopen starting Monday. The number of positive tests for the coronavirus grew Monday by 361, raising the state total to 25,208. The number of health care workers who have been infected rose to 2,725. The latest state figures showed 253 patients in Minnesota intensive care units Monday. Jackson: The Mississippi Department of Corrections says it will soon restart the transfer of inmates from county jails into state prisons and from one prison to another – a practice that has been on hold for about two months because of the coronavirus pandemic. The department said in a news release Friday that transfers will be done in a “limited, controlled and safe manner,” beginning in mid-June. Mississippi has about 18,000 prisoners in custody. As of Friday, 28 inmates and 17 employees had tested positive for COVID-19, the department said. Advocates for inmate safety have questioned whether Mississippi is doing enough testing for the highly contagious virus. Inmates will be quarantined at least 14 days before being moved out of South Mississippi Correctional Institution, Central Mississippi Correctional Facility or the privately run Tallahatchie County Correctional Facility. O’Fallon: Casinos are beginning to reopen in the state after a more than two-month shutdown caused by the coronavirus, and it was clear Monday that many people were eager to gamble. Nearly 100 people lined up awaiting the 9 a.m. reopening of Lumiere Place casino in downtown St. Louis, including many older adults, most wearing masks, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. According to state health department data, 579 of the 772 people in Missouri who have died from COVID-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus, were age 70 or older. Darryl Foster, 54, told the newspaper he wasn’t worried about the virus. “I look at it like it is what it is,” he said. “If it’s gonna get you, it’s gonna get you.” In the Kansas City area, gambling was resuming at Ameristar, Argosy, Isle of Capri and Harrah’s. The Kansas City Star reported several casinos would operate at a limited capacity, and some amenities such as live entertainment and buffets would remain closed. Bozeman: The Montana entrances to Yellowstone are still closed, but that hasn’t stopped several Big Sky tour companies from teaming up to be ready when those gates do open. Big Sky Adventures & Tours, Discover Yellowstone Tours, Yellowstone Scenic Tours, Yellowstone Tour Guide and Yellowstone Touring Company are normally in competition to get tourists on their vehicles and into the park. But this year is far from normal. “It makes more sense for us to work together and put aside competition and make a common plan so people feel safe,” said Andrea Saari, a co-owner and guide with Big Sky Adventures and Tours. The five companies got together to create a COVID-19 operating plan to submit to the park, a requirement for all commercial business going in and out of Yellowstone. Each company submitted its own copy, and, in a memo dated May 17, the park accepted Big Sky Adventures & Tours’ operating plan. Lincoln: Bars, zoos, swimming pools and other public venues were allowed to reopen Monday even as the coronavirus pandemic continues to loom as a major public health threat. The new, lighter restrictions approved by Gov. Pete Ricketts went into effect in 89 of Nebraska’s 93 counties. The new rules also allowed non-contact sports such as baseball, softball and volleyball to resume practices Monday, and games can begin June 18. Rodeos can also resume Monday, but contact sports such as football, basketball and wrestling will remain prohibited. Ricketts imposed the rules to try to prevent the coronavirus from spreading and overwhelming the state’s hospitals. State officials confirmed another 196 new cases Sunday, bringing the statewide total to 14,101. Of that number, 170 people have died from the virus. More than 103,800 people have been tested so far. Carson City: Health officials are reporting the state’s total number of COVID-19 cases is now past 8,600. The state Department of Health and Human Services updated its testing data Monday with a new total of 8,688 positive coronavirus cases. The number of known deaths is now up to 421. Gov. Steve Sisolak, a Democrat, last week eased closure orders enacted to prevent groups of people from gathering and possibly spreading communicable COVID-19. The governor allowed a second wave of businesses including bars and health facilities to reopen Friday and raised from 10 to 50 the number of people allowed at social gatherings, including religious services. He said gambling can resume Thursday under strict rules and oversight of gambling regulators. Casino companies have begun calling back some of their hundreds of thousands of furloughed employees. Concord: The owner of the Mount Washington Cog Railway implored a task force Monday to allow his business to reopen, even if it means stopping short of the summit of the Northeast’s highest peak. Wayne Presby, owner of the 150-year-old tourist train, presented proposed rules to the governor’s Economic Reopening Task Force that include initially limiting passenger car capacity to 50%, requiring passengers to wear face coverings, and running separate trains for New Hampshire residents and out-of-staters. By mid-July, capacity restrictions would be lifted, and individuals from any state would be allowed on all trains. “We also have the ability to offer shorter trips to reduce the time spent by guests in confined spaces,” he said. “If the committee feels it’s inappropriate for us to be taking trips all the way to the summit of Mount Washington, we can limit those to trips only partway up the mountain.” Trenton: Shoppers will soon be able to enter nonessential retail establishments, and restaurants may allow outdoor dining as of June 15, Gov. Phil Murphy said Monday. Salons and barbershops can serve customers June 22, if coronavirus cases and hospitalizations continue to decline, he said. Currently, retail stores and restaurants may only offer customers drive-thru or pickup options, but the governor said retail shops could let in a fraction of their capacity inside the stores. Murphy said the state will next discuss how gyms and health clubs can reopen safely but did not give an anticipated reopening date. Murphy has been taking a piecemeal approach to lifting measures meant to stem the spread of the coronavirus, announcing new measures each day. All day cares can reopen June 15, non-contact youth sports can resume June 22, and children can attend summer camps July 6. Indoor religious services may allow more people than the current 10 inside starting June 12 if coronavirus data continues to trend downward. Albuquerque: The state’s largest electric provider is asking state regulators to consider a proposal that would allow it to recover fixed service costs independent of how much electricity is actually consumed by customers. Public Service Co. of New Mexico is pursing what is known as decoupling, pointing to uncertainty amid the coronavirus pandemic. The utility recently filed its request with the Public Regulation Commission after announcing its intentions to shareholders in May. “Decoupling is designed to collect fixed costs – no more, no less,” PNM Director of Pricing Stella Chan told the Albuquerque Journal. “If we over collect, we’ll credit that back to customers, and if we under-collect, we’ll charge customers the difference to recover the costs we incurred.” New York: Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed a bill Saturday granting death benefits to the families of police officers, public health workers and other front-line workers who have died of the coronavirus. “You gave your lives for us; we will be there for your families going forward,” Cuomo said as he signed the legislation at his daily briefing on the virus. The bill passed by state lawmakers last week provides an accidental death benefit that is more substantial than the regular death benefit that public workers’ families receive. Dozens of police officers, public health workers, transit workers and paramedics have died of COVID-19 in the months since New York became the epicenter of the pandemic in the United States. Cuomo said he will focus this week on providing more testing for the coronavirus and more supplies like masks to neighborhoods in the outer boroughs of New York City where infection rates remain stubbornly high. Raleigh: As hurricane season began Monday, most of the state’s coastal counties are grappling with shortfalls or concerns about equipment and resources as they balance the dual threat of tropical weather and the COVID-19 pandemic. All 20 counties in the state’s coastal management zone said COVID-19 is factoring into hurricane preparations. Five of those – Chowan, Currituck, Dare, Hyde and Washington – said overall plans hadn’t changed, but they’re ready to adjust to the virus if needed. Fifteen counties acknowledged shortfalls or concerns about supplies, with protective gear being the most common worry during a national shortage. However, three others – Dare, New Hanover and Pender – said they have sufficient resources for hurricane season. The pandemic increases the stakes for a state hit hard in recent years by hurricanes Florence and Matthew. North Carolina Emergency Management Director Mike Sprayberry said hotels, classrooms and dorms are being considered as shelters to increase social distancing. Bismarck: State corrections officials are seeking up to $2.5 million in federal COVID-19 aid to give temporary pay increases to employees who are required to be in close contact with prisoners and others during the pandemic. The state’s top budget writer said Friday that other agencies whose workers cannot practice social distancing as part of their job may submit similar requests. The Department of Corrections will request the funds next month from the state’s Emergency Commission, which is headed by Gov. Doug Burgum. The money would come from the $1.25 billion that was given to the state in the federal stimulus package approved in March. Dave Krabbenhoft, the agency’s director of administration, said monthly pay increases of up to $300 would be provided until the end of the year to each of the more than 800 employees who qualify for the “hazard pay.” Cincinnati: Child care providers can begin to reopen this week, but they will look much different from how they did in March. There are new rules for cleaning and washing hands. Classrooms are capped at six for infants and toddlers or nine children for preschoolers and school-age children – half or fewer than they held before the coronavirus pandemic. Day camps were also given the green light to open Sunday with groups of nine children at most. But not all will start this week. Some might not open at all. Learning Grove, a nonprofit child care provider that has centers in Ohio and Kentucky with 60% low-income children, is staggering its openings. Some centers will open Monday and others June 8. Patricia Gleason, chief operating officer, said two state grants will help keep Learning Grove centers afloat for about two months. The agency is losing $10,000 to $25,000 per site per month, she said, because of pandemic-related rules. Oklahoma City: State prisons will reopen for inmate visitation starting next weekend, but with precautions to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, according to the state Department of Correction. Visitors must remain in their vehicle until called, wear a mask provided by the facility, complete a health screening, show no symptoms of the virus and maintain social distancing, the department said Friday. Visitors will be allowed to carry only an identification card, car key, and baby care items if a young child is present. The DOC suspended inmate visitation in March in an effort to prevent the spread of the virus. Hood River: State officials disclosed Friday that a Hood River County pear-packing company is the site of the latest COVID-19 outbreak connected to the agriculture industry. Six employees of Duckwall Fruit have tested positive for coronavirus, the Oregon Health Authority said. Duckwall Fruit is the first employer identified by state officials after they announced Thursday that they would disclose workplace outbreaks of at least five infections, The Oregonian/OregonLive reports. The decision came after the state received heavy criticism for initially declining to identify Townsend Farms in Multnomah County, which has had two outbreaks since late April, totaling more than 100 coronavirus cases. The investigation into the Duckwall Fruit outbreak started Friday, the state said. Officials say they are working with the business to address the outbreak and protect the health of workers. Harrisburg: State officials reported comparatively low figures for new COVID-19 infections and deaths Monday, a sign the pandemic’s impact may be on the wane. The Health Department said there were 12 additional deaths, bringing the total number this year to 5,567, of which 3,557 have occurred among nursing homes or personal care facilities. The agency said 356 new cases were reported, a figure that may reflect that reports from weekends have generally brought lower numbers. So far more than 72,000 Pennsylvanians have had confirmed cases of COVID-19. The number of infections is thought to be far higher than the confirmed count because many people have not been tested, and studies suggest people can be infected without feeling sick. Providence: Malls welcomed shoppers Monday as the state moves into the second phase of its economic restart. Providence Place and the Warwick Mall were both reopening late in the morning. Both closed in mid-March in response to the coronavirus crisis. The shopping centers are placing hand-sanitizing stations in common areas and will undergo frequent cleanings. At Providence Place, the food court will be open but with adjusted seating to maintain social distancing. Providence Place is also offering curbside pickup. Hair stylists, nail salons, gyms and child care centers are among the businesses that were allowed to open with restrictions Monday. Restaurants will also be allowed to offer indoor dining, but with limited capacity. Charleston: As the debate heats up over how to secure restaurant spaces during the coronavirus pandemic, a mainstay of downtown Charleston dining has come up with a particularly summery solution, The Post and Courier reports. “It’s a hard-core, full-height, double-wide lifeguard tower,” Edmund’s Oast owner Scott Shor said proudly, referring to the custom-built elevated watchtower that now looms over the restaurant’s popular patio. Shor was quick to point out that this is no mere social-media ploy, though it’s a sure bet it will pay dividends in free marketing via customers’ Instagram feeds. Like many restaurants reopening in the Charleston area, Edmund’s Oast has incorporated into its reopening plan new workplace roles responsible for overseeing dining areas and ensuring guests are complying with its safety guidelines. At the brewpub they’re calling that job the “lifeguard.” Pierre: The state has surpassed 5,000 confirmed cases of the coronavius, the South Dakota Department of Health said Monday. State health officials reported 41 new COVID-19 cases, bringing the state’s total to 5,034. The number of active cases was 1,069. The number of deaths reported in South Dakota since the start of the pandemic remains at 62. The Department of Health reported 87 people were hospitalized, an increase of one since Sunday. Of South Dakota’s confirmed coronavirus cases, Minnehaha County, the state’s most populous county, leads with 3,355. Nashville: A sexual and reproductive health advocacy group is launching a billboard and digital ad campaign intended to show how COVID-19 has exposed inequality, according to a news release. A billboard image released to media by Healthy & Free Tennessee reads, “End mass incarceration. Make parenthood and abortion accessible for everyone. Protect transgender youth.” Efforts to stop the spread of the coronavirus in Tennessee jails and prisons have included releasing inmates who are in jail solely because they cannot afford bail. Criminal justice reform advocates have said changes like that one need to become permanent. Gov. Bill Lee earlier tried to shut down surgical abortions to preserve personal protective equipment for COVID-19, but his executive order was overturned in federal court. Austin: The number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the state rose by nearly 2,000 Sunday, and there were another 24 deaths tied to the disease caused by the new coronavirus, according to health officials. There were at least 64,287 cases and 1,949 deaths, the Texas Department of State Health Services reported Sunday, an increase from 62,338 cases and 1,648 deaths reported Saturday. The true numbers are likely higher, however, because many people have not been tested, and studies suggest people can be infected and not feel sick. The department also estimated that there were 20,192 active cases and that 42,423 people have recovered. Logan: With outdoor recreation being one of the few activities available during the COVID-19 pandemic, campsites are undergoing a large uptick in positive and negative use. Local forest rangers are encouraging folks to treat campgrounds respectfully, extinguish campfires and plan ahead for trips. Cache National Forest Logan District Ranger Jennefer Parker said irresponsible gun shooting, garbage and trespassing are all on the rise this season. However, an increase in unattended fires is prompting the most concern. Parker said multiple citations were recently issued for people who “completely walked away” from their campfires. Parker said each time firefighters are called out increases their risk of exposure to the novel coronavirus. Additionally, Parker said the area is drier than usual for this time of year, which could cause a potentially higher fire risk. Montpelier: The state’s courthouses resumed more routine operations Monday for the first time since mid-March, but people will be required to wear masks and answer questions about their health. Courtroom staff have been instructed to maintain social distancing among the members of the public. “I think it’s going to look different in every courtroom because even if there’s a capacity for, let’s say, 25, not all of our courtrooms will allow for that,” said Vermont chief superior Judge Brian Grearson. The reopenings of the courts comes as a number of additional sectors of the Vermont economy are reopening. Other areas opening include massage therapists, indoor gymnasiums, cleaning services and some other close-contact businesses that will be able to resume limited operations. Vermont on Sunday reported a total of 981 positive cases and 55 deaths from COVID-19 so far. Norfolk: As hurricane season begins and the pandemic continues, the state’s largest city is facing the prospect of having fewer resources to respond to a major storm. Plummeting tax revenues are raising questions in Virginia Beach about how much funding would be available. Money would be needed for everything from running generators at pump stations to approving contracts to remove downed trees. “We know we get reimbursement down the road from FEMA,” said Erin Sutton, the city’s emergency management director. “But that takes time. And everything we do to respond to a hurricane is out of the city’s budget.” When a hurricane hits, Virginia Beach partners with about 35-plus relief groups, such as food banks, the Red Cross and Catholic Charities. Many have already stepped in to help people who’ve been hurt economically by the pandemic. Before that, some were aiding those affected by last year’s mass shooting at a municipal building. Seattle: King County planned to apply for approval to enter into a modified Phase 1 on Monday after Gov. Jay Inslee announced he wouldn’t extend the state’s COVID-19 stay-home orders. The Seattle Times reports that County Executive Dow Constantine announced Friday that the county, in consultation with officials at Public Health – Seattle & King County, will apply and begin reopening some business activity with limited or modified openings. The stay-home order, in place since March 23, expired Sunday night. So far, 26 of the state’s 39 counties are approved to enter Phase 2, which allows restaurants and taverns to reopen at half-capacity with limited table sizes; hair and nail salons and barbershops to resume business; and retail stores to reopen for in-store purchases at 30% capacity. It also allows additional outdoor recreation and gatherings with no more than five people outside of a person’s household. Charleston: Three people have tested positive for the coronavirus at Marshall University as the college is allowing athletes to return to campus for training, officials said Monday. A news release from the school said two student athletes and one staffer tested positive over the weekend. They have been quarantined, and a contact tracing investigation is underway. The college is making all student athletes self-isolate for a week when they return to campus. They must test negative before being allowed to leave. Marshall canceled in-person classes in March but plans to resume them Aug. 24, the college said. The school has reported five total cases since the outbreak began. The new cases come as Gov. Jim Justice moves forward with a plan to lift virus restrictions on sports in the state. The Republican is allowing youth sports teams to begin practicing again June 8, and games can resume with spectators June 22. Madison: The percentage of new positive COVID-19 cases in the state continued a downward trend Monday, based on the latest figures reported by the Department of Health Services. Only 4% of all tests reported Monday were positive, the third-smallest total in the past two weeks. In total, just over 18,500 people have tested positive in Wisconsin, and 595 have died. That was up by three from Sunday. However, there was a sharp decline in the number of overall tests processed. Gov. Tony Evers in April set a goal of testing 12,000 people a day for the virus, a target he said was needed before the state could safely reopen. However, on Monday only about 3,600 tests were reported as being completed. That was about half of the 7,300 tests reported Sunday and more than three times less that the 13,500 that were done Friday. Evers and health officials have urged anyone who wants a test to get one. Casper: Vital social services including child care assistance and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program are experiencing growing pressures resulting from the coronavirus pandemic. State Department of Family Services Director Korin Schmidt told lawmakers that additional funding will likely be required to meet rising demand, The Casper Star-Tribune reports. Schmidt told the Joint Committee on Labor, Health and Social Services that family enrollment in programs including SNAP, which provides food to needy families, experienced sharp increases between March and April that will likely continue into the summer. Measures implemented by the United States Department of Agriculture have increased the flexibility of the SNAP program, while the office of Wyoming first lady Jennie Gordon has helped organize funding to feed young people. But a federal block grant to cover child care services is likely to run out. From USA TODAY Network and wire reports"
90,90,"John Kasich, Chris Gregoire: How to safely reopen America as coronavirus still threatensChris Gregoire and John Kasich ","May 13, 2020",https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2020/05/13/kasich-gregoire-how-to-safely-reopen-u-s-amid-coronavirus-column/3114325001/,"Social distancing, stay-at-home orders and closures of schools and non-essential businesses have seemingly stopped America in its tracks. Many Americans are asking the same questions — when will this end and when can we safely get back to life, even if it is a new normal?  The answer: Look abroad.  On April 16, President Donald Trump released a three-part plan for opening America again. According to the plan, states should first meet criteria that includes a downward trajectory of confirmed cases or the percent of positive tests within a 14-day period.  While only a few states currently meet the president’s criteria, more than half have already partially reopened or set plans to reopen by the middle of May.  While each state plan may vary, one thing is certain — epidemiological data should drive decision-making. In addition, testing capacity and contract tracing to curtail transmission must be sufficient.   One silver lining for the United States is that many East Asian and European countries are temporally ahead of us on their respective pandemic curves and could offer lessons to inform our decision-making. Here are a few from a recent report by the Bipartisan Policy Center:  To loosen social distancing measures, some countries have outlined specific quantitative criteria to guide decision making. In Germany, federal and state officials are continuously monitoring the reproduction rate of COVID-19 to ensure that it stays below 1. Scientists suggest that a reproduction rate under 1 generally means the infection will spread slowly and eventually die out. This could be an important quantitative indicator for the U.S. beyond tracking confirmed cases.   Share your coronavirus story: Contact USA TODAY Opinion's hotline. We may publish your comments. Many countries are also setting time periods between loosening social distancing measures.  For example, Switzerland, Denmark and the Czech Republic plan to allow two to three weeks between opening various sectors of society. This is smart given the incubation period of the virus and the average time between presentation of symptoms and testing. In addition, some countries are prioritizing opening sectors that have both a low risk of transmission and are also vital to the economy such as construction and manufacturing.  With respect to schools, given that the school calendar in East Asian countries runs through the summer months, there may be opportunities for the U.S. to track their experiences.    The ability to loosen social distancing measures is largely dependent on increased testing. Many countries are prioritizing vulnerable populations for testing regardless of whether these patients are symptomatic. For example, Austria recently announced that all personnel and residents of retirement and nursing homes will be tested in the event that there is at least one confirmed COVID-19 case in an institution. To offer similar widespread testing, our states need more support from the federal government. Specifically, the U.S. will need to triple its testing capacity over the next several weeks to replicate other successful regions such as Veneto, Italy or at least align with the goals of other peer countries.    Contact tracing complements testing by ensuring that individuals exposed to the virus quarantine themselves for 14 days. During its first COVID-19 wave, Wuhan, China required 1,800 contact investigator teams of five people each before the city could reopen. Experts estimate the U.S. needs at least 100,000 contact tracers to help contain transmission. Congress should focus on addressing this issue in the next supplemental legislation so that the public health system is strengthened to respond to COVID-19. In addition, countries such as Singapore and South Korea have successfully used some form of technology-aided contact tracing.  The U.S. should follow suit while maintaining privacy standards. Overall, not every country’s approach can be applied in the U.S. as our country has different political, social and economic feasibility. However, there are important implications for federal and state government leaders.  Governors should communicate clearly, set transparent, quantitative metrics to guide decision-making, allow sufficient time between phases of opening and consider low-risk and high-yield sectors of the economy when reopening, and consider providing housing for individuals infected to isolate. Federal officials should standardize metrics, assist with testing, provide funds for contract tracing and bolster the public health infrastructure, launch a public awareness campaign on the use of cloth-based masks, and track schools abroad. At both the state and national level, private sector innovation should be leveraged to support efforts to safely reopen the country.  And all Americans need to continue to adhere to the basics — handwashing, respiratory etiquette, physical distancing and wearing cloth-based masks in public, especially when physical distancing is not possible. Let’s continue to lead, innovate and communicate to protect America’s health and get our country going again. Chris Gregoire is a former Democratic governor of Washington; John Kasich is a former Republican governor of Ohio."
91,91,How to protect loved ones from financial fraud during the COVID-19 crisisLinsey Knerl ,"May 21, 2020",https://www.usatoday.com/story/sponsor-story/five-star-premier-residences-of-yonkers/2020/05/21/how-protect-loved-ones-financial-fraud-during-pandemic/5215936002/,"Con artists are nothing new. Last year, the Federal Trade Commission stated that in 2018 alone, adults ages 60 and older reported losses of nearly $400 million, according to 256,404 fraud reports filed with the agency. While the numbers are shocking, older adults are surprisingly less likely than younger generations to fall for scams. When they do, it’s usually because the scams target new developments that they may not be aware of, due to either exposure or tech limitations. With coronavirus news changing daily, older adults are at increased risk of being unaware of these newer scams, and the FTC has identified five fraud types that have been making the rounds since the pandemic began. Read through the list below, and share the information with any older loved one who might need to hear it. The experts at Five Star Senior Living communities know that equipping seniors with knowledge is the best defense against criminals. 1. Ignore offers of a coronavirus vaccine The older adult population is vulnerable to all kinds of diseases, and the COVID-19 pandemic has amplified many seniors’ fears of becoming sick. If someone calls, emails or texts claiming to have a vaccine or cure for the coronavirus, ignore them. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the FTC urge anyone who receives information about these promises to hang up the phone or delete the email or text. There are no such medical treatments available at this time. 2. Be careful with testing While there are legitimate testing options through your local health care providers and community health departments, most will not contact you at home to offer you a test. If anyone claims that they can send you a test kit or wants to provide in-home testing, reach out to your doctor to see if this is a legitimate test. Many of the test kits being advertised for in-home use have not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Even the one FDA-approved test kit requires a doctor to facilitate it. 3. Look for new phishing attempts Phishing is the act of getting sensitive or financial information from a consumer through emails that appear to be from a trusted source — also called spoofed emails. The pandemic has created new opportunities for scammers to send out emails that look like they’re from the World Health Organization, the CDC and even local hospitals. Never click on links in an email without placing your mouse over the link to preview the source. Official government emails will come from addresses that end in “.gov” only. 4. Learn about economic relief options from the source Tax season is always rife with scam attempts, and this year’s economic stimulus payments have only complicated matters. If seniors are asking about when they will get their checks or how the money will be deposited into their accounts, visit the official IRS website’s resource page and walk them through how things work. Remind them that no one from the government will ever call, text or email them to get their account information. Those receiving Social Security payments will have their information on file with the government already and should have no reason to have to update bank information for their payments. The FTC has additional information about stimulus-related payment scams on its updated resource page. 5. Continue hanging up on robots Robocalls aren’t going away anytime soon, despite attempts by the recently signed Telephone Robocall Abuse Criminal Enforcement and Deterrence Act, or TRACED Act, to penalize companies that send out these creepy automated phone calls. In the meantime, review the signs of a robocall with your loved one. Does the voice of a caller sound computer-generated, stilted or unnatural? Does the call start with beeps or musical tones? Does it reference big brand names? Let your loved one know that it’s OK to disconnect any calls that seem scary or fake, especially if they don’t already do business with the company mentioned. What if your senior loved one has already given out information or fallen victim to one of these scams? While they may feel shame or embarrassment, remind them that they are not the one to blame. Make sure their claim is heard through the FTC, and do your part to warn others about the realities of coronavirus scams. Knowledge is power, particularly for older loved ones who do best when empowered to help themselves. If you are concerned about a senior loved one during the pandemic, the experts at Five Star Senior Living are always available to provide guidance."

Donald Trump and Nancy Pelosi are in a war of words. And how about that housing market? It's Alex. Happy Wednesday! But first, What Not to Wear™: Face Mask edition. Two people walked into a Virginia convenience store wearing hollowed-out watermelons. Police say they were there to steal. The Short List newsletter is a snappy USA TODAY news roundup. Subscribe here! First, rain. Then flooding. Now, two breached dams have prompted the evacuation of nearly 10,000 people in Michigan, and a city may be forced 9 feet underwater. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer declared a state of emergency Tuesday for Midland County after the Edenville and Sanford dams breached, warning that downtown Midland could be under 9 feet of water by Wednesday afternoon. The floods surpassed a high point of 33.9 feet set by a downpour in 1986, known as ""the worst natural disaster in the state's modern history."" Whitmer said that despite stay-at-home orders, anyone living in the affected areas should evacuate as quickly as possible. ""Please do not hesitate. Go to stay with a friend or relative or go to one of these shelters now,"" she said. Hydroxychloroquine. Heard of it? President Donald Trump and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi have been in a war of words since it was revealed that the White House physician prescribed the president hydroxychloroquine as part of his personal health care plan to avoid being infected with the coronavirus. The drug, commonly used to prevent and treat malaria and address autoimmune diseases, hasn't been proven to effectively treat or prevent COVID-19. Now let's catch up ... Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee, vowed in March to pick a woman as his running mate. Leaders within crucial factions of the Democratic base – black and Latino voters – say she must be a woman of color. Not only is it long past time to reward the party's most reliable voting bloc, black leaders say, a woman of color makes the most sense strategically to defeat President Donald Trump. More could ride on Biden's vice presidential pick because of his age – he would be 78 on Inauguration Day in 2021 – and the future of the party. Even if Biden loses, the running mate would almost certainly emerge as a contender to seek the party's nomination for president in 2024.  Florida scientist Rebekah Jones said she was fired for refusing to manipulate data in the state's COVID-19 dashboard, an allegation that undercuts the governor’s push to reopen the state. In response to the charge, Gov. Ron DeSantis defined the controversy as a ""nonissue"" and said Jones sent an email to her supervisor saying the comments were misinterpreted. “I don’t know who she is, but they gave me an email that she sent to her supervisor, said that, ‘Uh oh, I may have said something that was misrepresented,’ ” DeSantis said. Still, state Democratic officials are calling for an investigation into the incident. “Allegations that Florida’s government may have tried to manipulate or alter data to make reopening appear safer is outrageous,"" state Democratic Party Chair Terrie Rizzo said. Florida Agriculture Commissioner Nikki Fried requested that members of DeSantis' administration appear at the state’s next Cabinet meeting to answer questions about the accusations levied by Jones. Much of the U.S. economy is at a standstill, prompting worries about the real estate market and a pandemic-driven housing crisis. Many of the areas likely to be the hardest hit are those that were at risk before the coronavirus pandemic. Also at a greater risk are areas where housing costs are high relative to income and where recent spikes in demand may have created housing price bubbles. Is your city on the list?

93,93,NASCAR's health plan: How it will handle positive coronavirus test during return to racingMichelle R. Martinelli ,"May 17, 2020",https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ftw/2020/05/17/nascars-health-plan-handle-positive-coronavirus-test-during-return-racing/111789862/,"In the middle of the global COVID-19 pandemic, NASCAR is returning to the race track for the first time since March 8 with the Real Heroes 400 at Darlington Raceway on Sunday (3:30 p.m. ET, FOX). Like with just about every other sports organization, the coronavirus outbreak forced NASCAR to suspend its season. But that hiatus lasted for 10 weeks and eight races as officials tried to determine if racing could safely and reasonably come back. Now, with nine upcoming Cup Series races announced through June 21, NASCAR says it ""has a plan in place to minimize any risks associated with the virus."" ""I don't foresee any further shutdown for us,"" NASCAR president Steve Phelps said Saturday on the TODAY show. ""There are all kinds of different scenario plannings that we've done for both ourselves, our own officials, as well as the race teams, productions people. It takes a village to put on a NASCAR race, but it'll be a smaller village."" But with nearly 1.5 million confirmed COVID-19 cases and more than 88,000 deaths in the U.S., per USA TODAY's tracking, uncertainty about the future is ever-present, and people have questions. That's true of NASCAR and general sports fans who are pumped for competition to resume but aren't sure how exactly things will work or how these athletes will be kept safe while competing over an extended period of time. So here's our breakdown explaining why NASCAR says it isn't providing on-site testing, how it's trying to keep the essential personnel at the track safe and what the plan is if someone does test positive. Unlike other sports organizations - such as Major League Baseball, which has said it needs to be able to frequently test players and personnel for COVID-19 (including rapid point-of-contact testing) and receive the results quickly before competing - NASCAR will not have on-site testing. And it's directly related to nationwide access to tests, or lack thereof. NASCAR vice president of racing operations John Bobo said during a media teleconference on April 30: ""Those tests remain in short supply. Getting results can take two to three days. Really those tests should be targeted for people most in need."" Reigning NASCAR Cup Series champ Kyle Busch misspoke when he told SiriusXM Radio this week that antibody testing will be an option. It won't be, and Bobo explained on the April call with reporters that the infectious disease experts NASCAR consulted with raised questions about whether a positive antibody test actually translates to immunity. There are also concerns about false positives. Obviously. And the governing body is ready to fine team members up to $50,000 for breaking the rules. Health screenings: Though not the same as testing, there will be health screenings, including temperature checks, for people entering and exiting the track and randomly inside the venue. Medical professionals will evaluate everyone and will decide if athletes are able to compete utilizing additional factors, like heart rate and pulse oxygenation, to make a decision, FOX Sports' Bob Pockrass reported. Mandatory PPE: Throughout the race days, people at the track will be required to use personal protective equipment, like masks. No qualifying or practice: The only exception to this in the first four Cup Series races back is the Coca-Cola 600 at Charlotte, which will have qualifying. No fans: That's a given. For the first four Cup Series races NASCAR initially announced in its return and the subsequent five through June 21 announced Thursday, fans will not be in attendance. Additionally, NASCAR said there will be ""strict limits"" for who is allowed at the tracks and infields. NASCAR president Steve Phelps told the TODAY show Saturday: ""If you think about a normal NASCAR race, we have between 2,000 and 2,500 people who will be part of putting a race on. That number will be down to about 900. There's a footprint that is there. Only essential personnel will be allowed to be in the footprint. I am not essential personnel; I will not be in the footprint."" Social distancing: Garage and hauler areas will be more spread out with at least a six-foot buffer required between haulers and race cars. Once drivers are at the track, they will go to their motorhomes and stay there until it's time to get behind the wheel. NASCAR is also encouraging teams to minimize internal contact, like between pit crews and road crews, and at-track work spaces will be distanced from each other. ""With the way it's gonna go on Sunday, I'm gonna get to the race track that morning, sit in my motorhome, and then when it's time to go out there, I'm walking right to my car,"" Ryan Blaney explained on a Zoom call with reporters Thursday. ""And when I'm done, I'm walking right back. There's gonna be really limited contact."" Roster limits: Teams are limited to 16 people per car roster, and that includes the driver, crew chief, team owner and spotter. Contact tracing: Team members and other personnel at the tracks are being asked to keep a log of everyone they physically interact with with throughout race day, so if someone does test positive at some point, they'll know who they've been in contact with. One-day shows: NASCAR's first four Cup Series races announced in its return were specifically designed to be one-day trips, so the tracks are within driving distance of the sport's base in Charlotte. Weekend schedules related to practice, qualifying and one-day trips for the second slate of upcoming races have not been announced yet. While NASCAR is not testing drivers and other personnel, it said its medical liaisons can provide counsel and support for someone who might need a test or help getting one. It's likely that every potential situation will be different, and let's not forget that drivers and team members have their own doctors to consult too. This is where that contact tracing log will help. If someone tests positive for the novel coronavirus, NASCAR said that person will likely have to self-isolate for at least 14 days, along with anyone they've had contact with at the track. Phelps described NASCAR's plan as ""rock solid"" on the TODAY show, explaining: ""We've looked at scenario planning for hundreds of different things happening, including, obviously, someone showing symptoms of having the virus. So protocol's in place that would allow for us to have that person removed."" Drivers and crews are assigned specific, staggered times to report to the track for an entry screening. Per NBC Sports, drivers at Darlington are required to arrive at least four hours before the green flag, so that if someone fails their health screening and cannot compete, there is enough time for a backup driver to get to the track and race. As Chad Knaus, the crew chief for Hendrick Motorsports' No. 24 Chevrolet team, explained while on a Zoom call with reporters Thursday, his team has a backup roster already and is actively monitoring the health of the members on it just in case. He continued: ""Let's say Joe Mechanic gets up on Sunday morning, and he's getting ready to drive to Darlington and he's got a fever. He calls me, and I tell Joe to stay home, and we call Bob and bring him in. We call the proper people at NASCAR that this person has already been cleared and tested, and we're ready to rock and roll with this fellow. That's how we're doing it. ""I hope we don't have to deal with that, but we like to be prepared nonetheless in a case of emergency. We've dealt with everything from drivers all the way down to crew chiefs."" Judging by the responses Bobo and Steve O'Donnell, NASCAR's executive vice president and chief racing development officer, gave in April, they don't have all the answers to this one. Bobo said: ""If there are multiple positives, of course we're obviously going to look at everything that's gone on around there and investigate, see what we need to do to continue to be safe."" If a team member cannot compete after testing positive or coming into contact with someone who has, the process for that person returning is the same as for any other medical issue. NASCAR said that person will have to be cleared to compete by their physician and then inform the medical liaisons of that before coming back. Similarly, the governing body already has a system set up where drivers who miss races because of an injury or illness can apply for a waiver to be deemed playoff- and championship-eligible. These are granted fairly freely and are all but guaranteed if a driver has to miss some time for coronavirus-related reasons."
94,94,Fact check: The tune for taps was not found in a Confederate soldier's pocket by his Union fatherDoug Stanglin ,"May 19, 2020",https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2020/05/14/fact-check-false-claim-origin-buglers-taps-decades-old/5182484002/,"A touching story about the Civil War, a Union officer and his Confederate soldier son has circulated for years, claiming to explain the origin of taps, the distinctive bugle melody played at U.S. military funerals and memorials and as a lights-out signal to soldiers at night. Facebook user Jim Singletary posted the story May 2 in what appears to be a post-and-pass-along version. The story involves a Union officer father, identified as Capt. Robert Ellison, who discovers the body of a Confederate soldier one night on the battlefield in Virginia. According to the tale, the body turns out to be that of his dead son who had gone to the South to study music but never told the family he had joined the Southern army. Even more astounding, according to the story, the father — identified variously as Capt. Ellison, Elli or Ellicombe — finds in his son's pocket a piece of paper bearing a series of musical notes that form the haunting melody we now know as taps.  Although the military does allow the son to be buried on the Union side, so the story goes, they will not allow the Army band to play the funeral dirge because the boy had been a Confederate soldier. Instead, he is permitted only a lone musician, a bugler who grants the father's request to play the notes found on the paper, and taps is born. But there is no evidence to support the story, which has surfaced over the years, most recently in social media. Jari Villanueva, who was a bugler at Arlington National Cemetery as a member of the U.S. Air Force Band, has written extensively about taps and worked on and researched a three-year exhibit at ArlingtonCemetery called: ""Day is Done ... The History of Bugle Calls in The United States With Particular Attention To Taps."" Villlanueva tells USA TODAY that the father-son story first appeared in a 1949 television program for a short-lived ""Ripley's Believe it or Not"" program. The origin of the tale is recounted in a 1961 book about Ripley called "" Ripley: The Modern Day Marco Polo,"" by Bob Considine.  Considine says of the soap opera nature of the tale, ""The denouement of this is a coincidence incredible even by Rip's standards.""  According to Vanity Fair, Ripley collapsed while recording the taps program and died several days later. Villanueva says the tale was often passed along in the 1960s in mimeographed copies — the social media of the era — and apparently in a Dear Abby or Ann Landers column. According to Villaneuva, historians have traced the true origin of taps to a Union officer, Gen. Daniel Adams Butterfield, who was unhappy with the lights-out call used at the time during the Civil War, feeling it was too formal for day's end. He turned to a brigade bugler, Oliver Willcox Norton, to play an improvised arrangement of an official bugle call known as Scott Tattoo. That music had been set down in Silas Casey's ""Infantry Tactics,"" which notes various music used to direct troops, and had, in turn, been borrowed from the French.  Villanueva also discusses the topic in an NPR interview that is part of a YouTube post that includes a snippet of the original tune that Butterfield revised. The revised tune, according to historians, was first played at Harrison's Landing, Virginia, following the Seven Days' Battles in 1862. The fighting was part of the Peninsular Campaign. One of the first accounts of the origins of taps surfaced in an article in the 1898 issue of The Century magazine, in which a music historian, Gustav Kobbe, credits Butterfield with writing the tune outright. The article prompted a letter from Norton, the former bugler, who said Butterfield asked him to revise the earlier tune — now known as Scott Tattoo — to shorten some notes and lengthen others, while retaining the melody. ""After getting it to his satisfaction, he directed me to sound that call for Taps thereafter in place of the regulation call,"" Norton said in a letter to the magazine. ""The music was beautiful on that still summer night, and was heard far beyond the limits of our Brigade. The next day I was visited by several buglers from neighboring Brigades, asking for copies of the music which I gladly furnished. I think no general order was issued from army headquarters authorizing the substitution of this for the regulation call, but as each brigade commander exercised his own discretion in such minor matters, the call was gradually taken up through the Army of the Potomac."" At Norton's urging, the editors contacted Butterfield, who in large part confirmed the bugler's story, although he did not specifically recall Norton: ""The call of Taps did not seem to be as smooth, melodious and musical as it should be, and I called in some one who could write music, and practiced a change in the call of Taps until I had it suit my ear, and then, as Norton writes, got it to my taste without being able to write music or knowing the technical name of any note, but, simply by ear, arranged it as Norton describes. I did not recall him in connection with it, but his story is substantially correct."" A lengthy article on the topic by Russell H. Booth was published in 1977 in Civil War Times Illustrated that quotes extensively from the 1898 article in The Century. The article credits Butterfield for his role in shaping the tune, but is aimed largely at making it clear Butterfield did not write the tune. ""For the sake of historical accuracy, then let us give General Butterfield credit for having revised a portion of an earlier bugle call into a much better call,"" Booth writes. ""But let us not continue to say that he composed an entirely new call. It makes a good story but it is just not true. The earlier call was in print and in use long before Butterfield ever joined the army."" Villanueva spent 23 years in the Air Force Band in Washington, D.C., where he often played taps at Arlington National Cemetery and served as trumpeter, bugler, assistant drum major, staff arranger and music copyist. He said he has spent considerable time debunking the father-son story, which he says surfaces regularly.  ""There is no evidence to back up the story or the existence of Captain Ellison,"" Villaneuva says. ""If I had a nickel ... "" he says of his many efforts to set the record straight. Noting the variations in the spelling of the father's name, Villanueva says he may have inadvertently contributed to the Ellison version by inadvertently referring to Ellicombe as Ellison in an article debunking the tale.  Villaneuva says the tune that Butterfield revised can be found in three manuals: the Winfield Scott (1786-1866) manual of 1835, the Samuel Cooper (1798-1876) manual of 1836 and the William Gilham (1819?-1872) manual of 1861. The call referred to as the Scott Tattoo was in use from 1835-60, according to Villaneuva. A second version of Tattoo came into use just before the Civil War and was in use throughout the war, replacing the Scott Tattoo. Villanueva says the Tattoo was a general bugle call used to notify soldiers to assemble for the final roll call of the day. We rate the claim about the dead Confederate soldier, his Union father and the origin of taps as FALSE because it is not supported by our research. There is no evidence tracing the tune to a battlefield encounter between a Union officer and his dead Confederate son. At least one biographer says the tale was concocted by Robert Ripley, of ""Ripley's Believe it or Not,"" for a 1949 television program. Thank you for supporting our journalism.

95,95,"Trump says US will pass 10 million coronavirus tests this week, states will receive $11 billionJeanine Santucci and Courtney Subramanian ","May 12, 2020",https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/05/11/coronavirus-trump-says-us-pass-10-million-tests-states-get-11-billion/3111814001/,"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump said Monday that the country is on track this week to pass 10 million coronavirus tests conducted, and announced that states would be receiving additional funding for testing. Trump said the U.S. has been conducting about 300,000 tests per day and the number will go up ""substantially.""  ""This week the United States will pass 10 million tests conducted, nearly double the number of any other country,"" Trump said. States will be receiving $11 billion in funds from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act to help governors meet their testing goals, the administration announced Monday. ""This has all been approved, we've gotten it done, completed. The money is going out,"" Trump said. ""This major investment will ensure that America continues to conduct more tests than any country on Earth by far. The money is going to states, territories and tribes, with the states hardest hit by the coronavirus receiving up to $500 million. The cash will be allocated to states partly based the “burden of COVID-19” as well as the population estimate of each state, a senior administration official told reporters on a briefing call earlier on Monday. Admiral Brett Giroir said the federal government is ""going to be very specific"" in requirements for states to receive funding. ""There needs to be minimum numbers to be planned to test. They have to have plans for their vulnerable communities, including nursing homes, including those who are disabled, including those in prisons or who have working environments that they may have a more likelihood to spread the infection.""  Coronavirus live updates: Pence back in White House, at a distance; New York to begin reopening this week; confusion in UK COVID-19 expert:Coronavirus will rage 'until it infects everybody it possibly can' Nearly 80,000 Americans have died from the coronavirus and at least 1,324,000 cases have been reported, but the administration has insisted states are ready to begin lifting social distancing restrictions that have decimated the U.S. economy and left millions jobless. Trump touted the federal government's relationship with state governments on providing a ""capacity that's at this point virtually unlimited"" for testing and ventilators. Some state governors have clashed with Trump over the availability of resources in the last few weeks.  ""I said from the beginning that the federal government would back up the states and help them build up their testing capacity and capabilities, and that's exactly what has happened,"" Trump said. The president touted that the U.S. is conducting about 300,000 tests per day on Monday, but researchers at Harvard's Global Health Institute projected last week that the country needs to be conducting more than 900,000 tests per day in order to safely lift restrictions by May 15.  Four states that have already taken steps to resume public life - Florida, Georgia, Texas and Colorado - have not met the bare minimum of tests required to safely allow Americans to return to work and children to return to school, according to researchers. There was one distinction made during the Monday briefing, though. Trump said anybody who ""wants"" a test can get one but then tweaked his messaging after a reporter pointed out that there are more people in the country than there are tests.  Giroir stepped in and said that with the country's current testing capacity, anybody who ""needs"" a test is able to get one. He specified that those with respiratory illness symptoms or who are being contact traced can get tests. ""That's over 3 million tests per week. That is sufficient for everyone who needs a test, symptomatic, contact tracing, and to out best projections, the asymptomatic kind of surveillance to get that, and that's the way it is,"" he said. Trump added, ""If people want to get tested, they get tested, but for the most part they shouldn't want to get tested. There's no reason, they feel good. They don't have sniffles, they don't have sore throats."" The president said if someone does ""feel there's something happening,"" they are able to get tested. The announcement comes as the White House is facing fresh scrutiny for insisting it's safe for the rest of the country to return to work while requiring testing and contact tracing efforts for members of its staff - tools that not yet been made widely available.  Former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumed Democratic presidential nominee, penned a Washington Post op-ed criticizing the Trump administration for suggesting the country is ready to open without providing states the adequate testing capabilities its offering to its own staff.  White House officials sent West Wing staff an email on Monday stating that they must wear a mask upon entry and social distance from colleagues whenever possible, according to a senior administration official. Aides were also told that the White House will provide a mask to anyone who needs one.  Administration officials are taking extra precautions after two aides tested positive for COVID-19 last week. Vice President Mike Pence's spokeswoman, Katie Miller, tested positive for coronavirus along with a Navy valet who had been in the same room with Trump on Tuesday. "
96,96,NCAA medical chief explains what it might take for college football to return in 2020Steve Berkowitz ,"May 16, 2020",https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaf/2020/05/16/ncaa-medical-chief-complex-path-college-football-return-2020/5205679002/,"Two weeks from the date some college athletics departments are targeting for allowing athletes to start returning to campus for team workouts, NCAA chief medical officer Brian Hainline on Friday night provided an extensive, unvarnished look at what schools are facing as they try to get sports — especially football — going again. Speaking during a live interview on an NCAA Twitter site, Hainline described a world that shows much more promise regarding testing for COVID-19 than the one that existed when the sports world shut down in early March, but one in which the current reality remains that it may not take more than a few positive tests to shut down an entire team for 14 days. For that to change, Hainline said, schools would have to be in a position to test athletes every one to five days and the medical/scientific community would need to have a sufficient understanding of how the virus works to establish five-day quarantine periods. How any, or all, of this ultimately works for any individual school presumably will be determined by state, local and school officials. But based on the NCAA’s current return-to-play guidelines, Hainline’s comments mean that it would be recommended that athletes not share the same footballs for at least four weeks after activities resume, although he was not asked whether wearing gloves or attempting to sanitize footballs would mitigate that. Then there would be the additional, well-understood risk from all of the sport’s close contact. For some members of coaching staffs, Hainline said this might suggest they initially stay away from the team, and then wear a mask and maintain more distance from players and other coaches than they usually have. Meanwhile, athletes and coaches in winter and spring sports would do well to pay close attention to procedures and precautions being taken now because Hainline said it’s going take significant medical breakthroughs for the general environment around the virus to change. “There’s a whole new revolution of tests that have come out,” Hainline said, “and we’re measuring how good those tests are. Some of them are serology (antibody) tests that even can tell if you’re actively infected — not just if you have immunity — and some of them are even saliva-based tests where you don’t have to go into the nasopharynx to get the sample. There’s a turnaround in 15 minutes. (But) that’s not really perfected. So, we expect the testing to change even more considerably over the next 30, 60 days. “But … if a player tests positive right now, as we’re here, that player is going to have to be quarantined for 14 days, and then you’re going to have to look at all of the close contacts and you’re going to have to make decisions. And if the decision is that all of the close contacts are quarantined for 14 days essentially, well, that’s going to be really, really difficult.” As Hainline sees it, the idea would be for football programs to have two distinct sets of personnel: An inner bubble, for the players and those that are in close contact with the players, and an outer bubble of people who are necessary to run a football event, but who are not in the same close contact with the players. As testing improves — or current tests can become increasingly frequent — the picture changes. But even then, if teams can get to the point where they are playing games, the pregame testing regimen has to include everyone in the inner bubble. Of course, this starts getting expensive at a time when athletics departments and schools, generally, are working with decreased revenue. “If the testing is such that you can really monitor every one, three, five days, or you have a five-day quarantine and you can predict with more certainty what’s going to happen after five days,” Hainline said, “you can start then imagining that there are scenarios where you don’t have to shut down an entire team or groups of teams for two weeks at a time. “The answer is really going to depend on two things, and we keep emphasizing this: One is that you have exceptional surveillance and contact-tracing available, and the other is that you have testing. “The other thing as we’re sitting here right now … if you’re going to have a football game, before that game starts … all of the people in the inner bubble are going to be tested. That doesn’t mean that those individuals won’t test positive on Monday, but it means that day, it’s the best you have. …  That increases the cost of the infrastructure of running a football program, but at least right now, that’s the necessary stuff that we see.” Speaking on the same Twittercast, West Virginia athletics director Shane Lyons — who chairs the NCAA Division I Football Oversight Committee — said that before getting close to games, everyone in college athletics will need to have a change in mindset. “We have the mentality that we’re athletes, if I get sick I just fight through it,” Lyons said. “And (coaches and administrators) have got to be able to say to (athletes), ‘If you feel sick at all, this is not the time to (worry about) people thinking that you’re weak.’ Educate them to say 'get your temperature, let us do the test' — do this as opposed to spreading this to other people if they end up having the virus.” Hainline said another cultural change will involve older staffers and those with pre-existing medical conditions that would make them more susceptible to the virus. The recommended protocols for all this potentially get so detailed that Hainline said he and the NCAA’s medical advisory panel haven’t yet addressed them. But it comes down to some people who are accustomed to working with athletes in up-close ways needing to back off at least initially, and maybe longer. “For those … that are higher risk, it would be better to be working virtually even as we start to make certain that we can handle this properly,” Hainline said. “But then, even as you get into the season, it’s still a higher risk for those individuals and we haven’t gotten down to that granular level. But I certainly can see the coaches being more distanced or wearing face masks or making certain that they’re protected in certain ways.” In terms of the actual using-a-football part of preparations for a season, Hainline referenced the NCAA medical panel’s guidelines for a multi-phased approach. Phases 1 and 2 each would last at least two weeks, and, he said: “We recommend that shared balls not be a part of Phase 1 and Phase 2. There certainly is that possibility — perhaps even a probability — that the virus can be transmitted by a shared ball."" While much of this may sound stark, Hainline said this may simply have to become sports’ new normal for at least the next 12 months. “This is what the experts that I’ve been working with have said,” Hainline began. “We’re cohabitating with this virus for a while. It’s unlikely that this is just going to magically disappear or mutate out in the near future. “We talk about a vaccine and we’re all very hopeful about that, but a very close relative of this particular coronavirus led to SARS — we don’t have a vaccine for SARS. We don’t have a vaccine for AIDS/HIV. There’s a lot of very focused activity on this, but even in the best-case scenario, that’s pushing well into 2021. And then, there’s probably going to be a large percentage of the population that is going to develop this no matter what we do because this is such a highly contagious virus. “So, at some point a large percentage of the population will have immunity, we hope. But that takes time to develop, and, so, really, we’re looking into 2021 and even next summer of 2021. … That’s the new normal until there’s either a treatment that neutralizes this virus or we have an effective vaccine or the virus is really no longer causing such havoc on our population because so many people are immune.”"
97,97,"Socially-distant concerts from Keith Urban, Travis McCready, more signal changes to live music","May 20, 2020",https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/2020/05/20/coronavirus-travis-mccready-eli-young-band-attempt-distant-concerts/5226779002/,"NASHVILLE, Tenn. — The last time bassist Jon Jones played a concert with his country group Eli Young Band was March 8. He hopes to hit the stage again in June to launch a new drive-in concert series in his first return to live music with fans since the devastating coronavirus. “This is going to be a surreal kind of setting,” Jones said of plans to play acoustically to 400 cars full of people at the new Texas Rangers stadium in Arlington, Texas. As states start to let businesses reopen under limitations, music industry organizers are testing out new models of smaller, socially distant concerts. Jones is cautiously optimistic that drive-in concerts might help crack open a door for musicians that slammed shut so quickly in March. “We’re going to be one of those last industries, those last segments that opens up, unfortunately,” Jones said. “I do hope that everybody is cautious and opens up appropriately and slowly.” George Couri, of artist management company Triple 8 Management, teamed up with the Rangers to put on the four-night concert series called Concert in Your Car starting June 4. The interest was so high that tickets sold out quickly and additional shows were added. In all 3,200 tickets have been sold. “It’s about creating an experience for live music again,” said Couri. “The big driver for me is to prove it can work. It would give people hope that this can be repeated again and again in many different places.” Staying Apart, Together:A newsletter about how to cope with the coronavirus pandemic More:Travis McCready concert shut down by coronavirus concerns gets official OK from Arkansas But the path ahead for live concerts hasn’t been easy. A venue in Arkansas initially had to postpone an indoor concert that would have defied the state’s ban on large gatherings after health officials ordered the show shut down. The concert featuring singer Travis McCready went on Monday night. Drive-in concerts aren’t new, but in the wake of the pandemic, the idea hit in Europe and now the United States. Country star Keith Urban played a drive-in theater in Tennessee last week with scaled back production and crew, but he said that he thinks the concert industry in the near future will pivot to a drive-in style, but with larger capacity. “The stage is going to be coming out to the parking lot and people will be staying in their cars,” said Urban. “It will be an endless tailgate party.” In Florida, DJ D-Nice, who has been entertaining people online with his popular DJ sets on Instagram called #ClubQuarantine, played music for first-responders in their cars on Saturday. Concert promoter and venue operator Live Nation is planning to test fanless concerts, drive-in concerts and “reduced capacity shows” both indoors and outdoors, according to President and CEO Michael Rapino, who spoke about the ideas on an investor call. Tailgate Fest in California already proved the car-centered concert was a viable option before the pandemic. The country music festival where fans are encouraged to watch from their RVs, trucks or cars is going into its third year this August. Melissa Carbone, the CEO of Tailgate Fest, said there are a lot of changes coming to the festival this year because of the coronavirus, including removing a general admission pit area and a VIP pool party, and they are expecting attendance to drop from last year’s high of 25,000. But the lineup of Dierks Bentley, Lynyrd Skynyrd and TLC hasn’t changed as of yet. “We’re ahead of the curve on it and nobody wants to see live music go away,” said Carbone. The World Health Organization has guidance and risk assessments for mass gatherings during the COVID-19 outbreak, said Lucia Mullen, an analyst at Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security and part of the WHO’s expert cell for mass gatherings and COVID-19. For concerts, Mullen said recommendations included moving events outdoors, limiting attendance, spacing people out, taking temperatures of participants and staff, hand sanitizing stations and extra cleaning. But she said organizers should also look at the aftereffects of holding a mass gathering in an outbreak, such as contract tracing. “Do they know who is going there so they can follow up with them if they do find out there is a case and alert all of the participants so they can go get themselves checked out?” asked Mullen.

More:Pearl Jam, Greta Thunberg paint grim picture of environment's future in 'Retrograde' video In a rapidly changing outbreak, Mullen said event organizers should rely heavily on the advice of local health officials in their areas. “Mere weeks can change an epidemiological context in a city,” she said. For most bands, touring is a large majority of their income, well above what they get for releasing albums. But Couri said this initial launch of drive-in concerts at the Texas stadium won’t be a huge money-making endeavor early on. They are charging $40 for each car, and all tickets have to be purchased in advance, not on-site. No concessions or merchandise will be available for sale to reduce contact between people. All bands will play acoustically so there’s minimal production crew needed. There won’t even be outdoor speakers because the music will be transmitted by radio. Jones said for him and the members of Eli Young Band, they aren’t doing the drive-in concerts solely to make up lost income, but instead to give music back to the fans. “I think people need something safe that they can go do and if we can be that, that’s awesome,” said Jones."
98,98,NCAA's Mark Emmert: Scale of college sports makes it 'almost inevitable' athletes will get coronavirusSteve Berkowitz ,"May 15, 2020",https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/college/2020/05/15/ncaa-president-mark-emmert-2020-college-sports-return-coronavirus/5202975002/,"NCAA President Mark Emmert said Friday that the breadth of college sports programs across the country makes it “almost inevitable” athletes will get sick from COVID-19 and that large-scale testing and tracing not yet available are critical to the resumption of on-campus athletics activities. In an interview with CNN, Emmert said college sports officials have conveyed the need for such testing to ""everyone from President Trump on down"" and Emmert added he is ""very hopeful"" it will happen. Some schools have been eying June 1 as a date to begin allowing athletes to return to campus for team activities. Emmert also said that because schools ""very likely” will be re-starting their athletic programs at different times, college sports are likely to have shortened seasons and the NCAA may have to rearrange the schedules for its fall championships, perhaps moving them into the winter. Emmert reiterated his position that at least some students must be allowed to return to campuses for in-person class instruction for sports to resume, but he said: “I'm not the ultimate arbiter to this. It's going to be a decision that each of the campuses is going to have to make on their own.” Responding to a question about what happens if an athlete tests positive for COVID-19, Emmert said: “We have literally a half-million student athletes. We’ve got 1,100 different schools that participate in NCAA sports -- 19,000 teams, not 32 (the number of teams in the NFL). So, to me, it’s not if a student comes down with the virus, it’s when. I think it’s almost inevitable with those kinds of numbers. “And so you have to have in place the protocols for testing, for tracking symptoms, for tracking contact and the ability to quarantine individuals and those they’ve come in contact with when this occurs. Same thing with regular students. It's impossible to believe that you can bring 40,000 students back to campus and all the faculty and staff and not have somebody sooner or later contract the virus. So it's how you react to it that's going to be critical.” CORONAVIRUS & SPORTS: Get the latest news and information right in your inbox.

COLLEGE AD:School is budgeting as if it won't play Oklahoma football game WHAT'S NEXT:One NCAA school's first steps to bringing athletes back ACC:Conference planning for every scenario in 202-21 sports seasons MAC:Trims basketball tournaments, eliminates other postseasons entirely An NCAA medical advisory panel has published a document that the association titled the “Core Principles of Resocialization of Collegiate Sport.” But they are presented as a set of guidelines, not rules. “In the end,” the document notes, “school and government leadership determine who can participate in, assist with, and watch student-athlete practices and competition. Among the guidelines are: ►Access to “reliable, rapid diagnostic testing on any individual who is suspected of having COVID-19 symptoms.” ►The availability of “a local surveillance system so that newly identified cases can be identified promptly and isolated, and their close contacts must be managed appropriately.” Emmert said the need for adequate testing is “what we have been communicating to everyone from President Trump on down. Testing is going to be one of the critical variables here. Today we don't have access to that level of testing that you can check every student that walks on campus or every athlete that walks on to a field or a court at this stage. “But we're very hopeful that will be case going forward. They’ve given all kinds of reassurances that's going to be the case. And it's going to be critical to making this work. That's what we're all pushing hard for.” Emmert said the association is preparing for schools to have varied approaches to resuming sports programs. The NCAA Division I Council, which oversees day-to-day rules-making, is scheduled to meet next week – and its agenda likely will include consideration of temporary changes to a variety of rules related to start and end dates of seasons and game scheduling. “We’d all love to have a single date, and say, ‘OK, we’re going to start’,” Emmert said, “but that’s not going to happen in the economy, it’s not going to happen on campuses, it’s not going to happen with sports. So, we're going to have to be more flexible around the sort of competitive-equity questions, if you will. That’s always going to take second seat to health and safety. “We’ll have to have abbreviated seasons, probably, in some cases. And we may even have to move our championship schedules around for the fall and perhaps even into the winter, but we're not going to compromise health and well-being.”"
99,99,Coronavirus questions: 10 things we still urgently want to know about COVID-19 in the next 100 daysAdrianna Rodriguez ,"May 27, 2020",https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2020/05/27/coronavirus-covid-19-pandemic-10-questions-answers-us-death-toll-100-k/5229575002/,"Doctors, scientists and epidemiologists have made strides in their research to learn what they can about SARS-CoV-2 and the illness it causes, COVID-19.  Multiple vaccines are in different stages of development as institutions scrutinize the effectiveness of existing drugs to treat coronavirus patients in clinical trials. Social distancing restrictions and lockdown measures have flattened the curve in parts of the country, and states have begun reopening in phases.  But experts say that there's more to learn about the virus, and as the United States surpasses 100,000 deaths, many wonder if that learning curve is just too steep.  The loss is staggering: Honoring the 100,000 lives lost to the coronavirus Let’s take a moment to honor the lives of those we have lost, and begin to comprehend the wound they leave behind. These are the top 10 questions we hope to have answers to in the next 100 days.  This is the number one No. 1 question on everybody's mind. Unfortunately, the answer is complicated.  President Donald Trump announced this month the launch of Operation Warp Speed, a government coordinating effort aimed at securing a coronavirus vaccine by the end of the year. But vaccine experts have consistently urged caution in presuming a vaccine will be available soon. The White House Coronavirus Task Force's Dr. Anthony Fauci has said that a vaccine is likely within the next year or two, and the process takes time.  ""You can rush vaccine development, but only when you understand – there’s no way around it – you are trading safety for speed,"" said Dr. Greg Poland, director of the Mayo Clinic's Vaccine Research Group. Oxford University in England and Maryland-based vaccine company Novavax seem ahead of the global race as their vaccine candidates have shown success in animal trials. But many experts say the process will be even longer as mass production to make the vaccine widely available to everyone at once is nearly impossible. The government will be forced to decide who will receive the vaccine first and allocate doses accordingly.  Sad milestone:Coronavirus death toll reaches 100,000 in U.S. Mitch Albom:100,000 Americans are dead. We’re all potential victims and killers While testing has accelerated since the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention stumbled in its initial rollout, it's still not perfect.  Many parts of the country still reserve tests only for patients who present symptoms. ""If you are symptomatic with a respiratory illness, that is an indication for a test and you can get a test. If you need to be contact traced, you can get a test,"" said Adm. Brett Giroir, the assistant secretary for health at the Department of Health and Human Services. But studies have shown that many infected people never present symptoms, and public health experts have called for enough testing to reveal the asymptomatic carriers of the disease.  Trump said 300,000 tests are now being done nationwide every day. But last week, a report from the Harvard Global Health Institute found that the U.S. should be doing 900,000 tests a day by May 15 to safely reopen.  According to their model, more than 40 states have not reached the level of testing needed, including four – Colorado, Florida, Georgia and Texas – that have already reopened.  Experts say people should be careful about how they interpret results of COVID-19 antibody tests that haven't been validated by government regulators as manufacturers flooded the U.S. market with tests that vary widely in accuracy.  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration made the rush to market possible by allowing COVID-19 antibody test manufacturers to self-validate their products without first submitting the data to regulators. Amid criticism of that policy, the FDA changed course in early May. Citing unnamed “unscrupulous actors” marketing fraudulent tests, the agency said manufacturers must meet new accuracy standards and submit proof of testing quality. At that point, the FDA had given emergency use approval to 12 out of more than 200 antibody test manufacturers. The FDA is working with other government offices to assess the performance of antibody tests. Results have not been made public.But even if antibody testing gets more accurate with the FDA's new guidelines, experts still can't confirm the presence of antibodies mean immunity to the virus.   Next 100 days:How the coronavirus will continue to change your life 10 important lessons:As it hits 100K deaths, has the US learned anything? As experts race to find a treatment for COVID-19, the experimental drug remdesivir is showing some promise. Data from a global study released at the end of April found patients given the drug recovered faster and may be less likely to die. The study, conducted by the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, found patients who received remdesivir had a 31% faster recovery time than those who received a placebo. Remdesivir is an experimental antiviral drug from the American biotech firm Gilead Sciences. It was originally tested as a treatment for Ebola and other coronaviruses including SARS and is now being tested as a possible COVID-19 treatment. Many scientists caution, however, against drawing any conclusions about remdesivir and say other recent studies found no clinical benefits to the drug.  Convalescent plasma and immunomodulators like tocilizumab have been given to patients with COVID-19 in clinical trials, but remdesivir is the only treatment that has been shown to have even a potential effect on the disease.  Trump confirmed to reporters May 18 that he had been taking the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine daily for the past week and a half; however, there has been no solid evidence of the drug's effectiveness. In fact, doctors caution against using hydroxychloroquine outside of its intended purpose or in clinical trials as the long list of side effects can be harmful.  Concern for reinfection was initially raised after reports out of South Korea that some people were becoming reinfected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. The country’s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported more than 300 such cases. South Korea has one of the world’s most extensive COVID-19 testing programs, so its data is considered strong.  South Korean researchers now believe they were seeing false positives, in which the tests detected old particles of virus in patients no longer causing disease, Reuters reported. It’s still not known whether having had COVID-19 gives long-term immunity to the virus, but immediate reinfection is now less of a worry.

Texas could be a telling case. The state became one of the first to take aggressive measures, allowing restaurants and retailers to reopen to limited customer capacity May 1. On May 14, Texas reported its highest single-day increase of new cases, with 1,448, according to the Johns Hopkins University data dashboard.  Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, warned May 12 in a Senate committee hearing that reopening the country amid the coronavirus pandemic may lead to ""some suffering and death."" But experts say it's unlikely we'll see a rise in cases in the next few weeks as states reopen for the summer. Officials say we're more likely to see that surge in late summer or fall because the coronavirus incubation spans from about five days to 11 days.  Even as states reopen, officials warn residents that life won't be as they knew it.  Instead, they should expect a ""new normal"" where sports stadiums remain empty and national parks offer limited services for their visitors.   The Transportation Security Administration announced changes to its screening process to include social distancing measures, relaxed carry-on liquid requirements and boarding pass etiquette.  Restaurants were forced to think creatively as they reopened. Some are allowing customers to sit outside on their deck or patio at 50% occupancy. Cities in Florida, Nevada and Maine temporarily closed their streets to allow diners to eat comfortably and safely on the street.  A restaurant in Ocean City, Maryland, created special tables with oversized inner tubes to keep all clients at least 6 feet apart. ""It's like a bumper boat, but it's actually a table,"" owner Shawn Harmon said. . The health care landscape has drastically changed since the pandemic arrived in the United States. Doctors restructured office waiting rooms and now greet patients who are daring enough to keep regular visits wearing masks. Hospitals cut elective surgeries, limited visitors and scrambled to provide protection for workers. Tests and annual checkups have been postponed or converted to virtual visits. Precautions affecting the way most Americans access basic health care are expected to last. Without a vaccine – not expected even optimistically until sometime next year – the risk of transmitting the virus that causes COVID-19 remains high. Tips to minimize risk:Leaving your coronavirus isolation? Think about these 3 things first So what will the future of medicine look like as the U.S. adapts to the new pandemic landscape? Expect more remote doctor visits, tenuous hospital care in rural areas and increased preparedness.  “For years, we’ve talked about the promise of telemedicine and its opportunities,” said Mark Holmes, professor at University of North Carolina Gillings School of Global Public Health. “But what the last two months has shown us is that it could really be a game-changer.” Elections are still being held throughout the country even as the threat of infection looms over the heads of voters.  Wisconsin's Supreme Court overturned the state's stay-at-home orders, and  April's primary resumed; some voters stood in line for hours in the midst of a pandemic. Thousands of absentee ballots either weren’t sent out or ended up lost in the mail, and others were returned too late to be counted.  Five states allow voters to cast their ballots from home in all of their elections: Colorado, Hawaii, Oregon, Washington and Utah. Those states send registered voters a ballot at least seven days before an election to fill it out at their convenience, and voters either mail it back or drop it off at any center that's closest to them. While a vote-at-home system may be more efficient overall, the startup costs of implementing it could be substantial. But experts say they may be cheaper over time as the cost of poll workers are much lower.  And so far, states that use vote-at-home have seen increases in turnout. In a 2019 study of Utah, 21 out of 29 counties conducted general elections by mail. Voter turnout in that 2016 election was 8.7 points higher in the counties that implemented vote-at-home than in those that had not.  Trump has repeatedly tweeted his opposition to such plans – and just this week threatened to cut off federal funding to two states, Michigan and Nevada – over mail voting. Trump and other Republicans have argued that a vote-at-home system has “tremendous potential for voter fraud.” But advocacy groups such as the National Vote at Home Institute and the Brennan Center for Justice strongly dispute such claims. Before the outbreak, the U.S. Census Bureau had planned to hire as many as 500,000 workers to knock on doors and get households that didn't respond to answer the survey.  While those hiring efforts are underway online, the agency was forced to suspend field operations in March and only recently restarted those operations in phases. As of May 18, a handful of Area Census Offices made the list. Agency officials continued to urge people to respond to the Census online, by mail or by phone. Invitations to respond started arriving in households last week. ""We recognize that many people plan to access the 2020 Census through other response modes, such as phone or paper, which is why the 2020 Census has such a nimble design,'' the agency said in a statement.  Plans for the nationwide count have been underway for years. The population survey is key to apportioning Congressional districts and determining the distribution of billions in federal funds for schools, infrastructure and health systems.
